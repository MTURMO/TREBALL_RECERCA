      "let me just start off by addressing the choking \"issue\" i keep reading about  please don t leave your child unattended with this toy  or most toys   and you won t have to worry about choking   i m pretty sure the instructions probably say that  but in this case it s especially important  i can see how the back legs could get wedged but the long legs are why baby loves it so much!moving on  hubby was way skeptical about putting this on our registry  and then buying it when no one purchased it for us    he said \"that had better be one magical toy\"   and now he admits that it is  and that it was worth the money our little guy adores his sophie  and it was one of the first toys he could hold onto and chew on  starting when his chewing obsession began around 2 months   now  at almost 9 months  he s still chewing away  and also adores playing \"peekaboo\" with sophie  when she squeaks just out of sight  and then appears my only  very minor  complaints are that 1  it can be a bit of a dirt attracter because of the material  as are the other silicone type teethers  not just specific to sophie    2  if you have a dog  they may think the toy is theirs   we can t send sophie along to the babysitter s house because her dog goes nuts overall  a must have baby item   no question \n",

      "i loved reading the story that comes with sophie  about how this toy is made just as it was in 1956  in the same process from the same all natural materials  tree sap or natural rubber    i have tried dozens of teether toys with both my daughters  my 5 month old loves chewing on sophie s feet or head  she smiles when i squeak her  if i give her one of the wooden teething toys she cries  too hard and big/heavy  and if i give her the plastic rings  she also cries  again i think too hard   sophie is amazingly soft and seems very durable  i have not seen any fading of the colors at all  wonderful toy  worth the price \n",
      "214\n",
      "well i never used it because i haven t teethed in quite some time  i sent it to my niece who i only see a couple times a year   i think it either got lost in the million other toys or became a dog toy   it was pretty cute though   i hope she liked it  what do i care? she s a baby   she s not going to remember little sophie   but perhaps it made her feel better and now she won t go into the rest of her childhood with this nagging unhappiness hangover from infancy   who knows?  like the title says  nice giraffe   maybe i will get myself one \n",

      "my mom in law bought sophie for my son when he was just starting to really chew on things  and we were hearing some pretty scary things about toys not made in the usa   she did some research and came across sophie and we are so glad that she did! while sophie doesn t come from the usa  we love the fact that she is 100% safe and natural  and my son loves to play with her  i also love how soft sophie is  my son tends to swing his toys around and when he s sitting on my lap i m usually in danger of being hit in the face with whatever he s holding  needless to say a soft toy is even better in my book! there s one last thing i want to comment on  i ve read reviews that said that sophie was a \"glorified dog toy\" or something to that effect  and i don t want to seem rude  but i think they re crazy! yes sophie does squeak   which my son didn t care about much at first but now he loves  but that s about as far as the comparison could go! if you want a quality teething toy for your child then look no further! sophie is adorable  soft  perfect for little hands  100% natural  and safe!!!!!!! definitely worth every penny!!\n",

      "i was very skeptical and read all the  horror  stories of sophie being unsafe  but my daughter was having a hard time teething  so i bought it   my daughter loves sophie  i have no idea what it is  but she just gets the biggest smile when i pull her out   like others have said   i just use common sense with it  any toy can potentially be dangerous  i watch her with it and don t let her have it in the car where i cannot see what s going on   but she has never even come close to choking or having any sort of danger with this teether   it has definitely helped with her teething and i d recommend it to anyone \n",

      "is it worth it?  with so many inexpensive teethers on the market in all shapes and sizes  why is this one so popular?  yes  it s trendy   yes  the celebrities all have these for their babies   yes  it s european   but is it really worth the price for your baby?that s the question i ve been asking myself ever since receiving vulli sophie the giraffe as a gift from a well meaning  and much hipper than i am  friend   my answer is a qualified \"yes \"  here are the benefits   this teether is several inches tall  making it larger than many other teethers   also  it has a lot of appendages  four legs and a long neck    these features make it easy for my uncoordinated baby to hold on to this teether   that s a big benefit   also  the shape of the legs and head result in a variety of teething choices   my baby prefers to grip the teether by the legs and to chew on the giraffe s ears or nose   i ve seen other babies who prefer to chew on the front or back legs   one baby i know even prefers to chew on the giraffe s rump   with so many choices  your baby is bound to discover one that she/he likes   additionally  the teether makes a squeaky sound when squeezed  think about a traditional dog squeaky toy    my baby likes this sound  as do my dogs    finally  the all rubber surface of this teether makes it easy to clean   these are the benefits here are the downsides   the rubber on this teether is a bit stinky and definitely has a taste that my baby isn t thrilled about   she s willing to put up with it  but i can tell that the taste isn t as pleasant to her as that of some of her other teethers   also  this teether doesn t have any rough patches or bumps  and those bumps are soothing to babies with serious teething going on   finally  this teether costs double or triple what other teethers cost  and that s a big downside if you re buying this for your own baby   so  weigh the pros against the cons and make a decision if this teether is right for you \n",

      "after all the hype i have heard about how this giraffe is the best teething toy and how much babies love it  i decided to try it for my four month old son   i was wary of spending so much on a baby toy  however  so i used a coupon and a gift card to purchase it   thank goodness i didn t spend $17 on this!  it is kind of cute  but i was immediately disappointed by the flimsy rubber and almost \"dog toy\" quality of the toy   then i squeezed the darn thing and it let out the loudest squeak!  not impressed   my son does kind of like to chew on it  but the squeak scares him!  my husband squeezed it to try to entertain him the other day  and the baby started crying! some kids might enjoy the sound  but i don t think this is going to be one my child s favorite toys update  august 29  2011 :  i take back what i said about sophie   my son is now 9 months old  and he has grown quite fond of sophie   he actually likes the squeak now  and he loves to chew on her   still not sure if she is worth $17  but i am glad i bought her!  i m changing my rating from 2 stars to 4 \n",

      "448\n",
      "at first i was skeptical  i mean $17 for a chew toy that looks more like a dog toy? but  after reading the reviews and going nuts with a teething baby i gave it a shot and bought one  as soon as our daughter saw it she smiled  and as you know that s worth a million bucks  and although she wasn t very good with her hands yet  she tried to get it in her mouth  after an incident where our puppy grabbed sophie and ran around the yard with her we figured we better get a back up or two  sophie is our go to girl whenever baby is crying  bored  cranky  sleepy  you get the picture  she seems to make everything better  and anyone with a small baby knows  that alone is worth the $17 \n",

      "451\n",
      "i had put sophie on my registry  but no one purchased it  i m guessing the high cost   i knew that i wanted it after reading the reviews  so i purchased it before my baby was even born  my husband thought i was crazy for spending 20 dollars on a little giraffe toy  but he later realized that it was twenty dollars well spent  when i saw my son starting to put objects into his mouth  i knew it was time for the sophie  this toy has become his favorite toy  no matter where i go  i make sure i have sophie  it will keep him distracted and entertained for a good time  so in conclusion  bite the bullet and buy sophie  you ll be very glad that you did \n",

      "535\n",

      "536\n",
      "we bought sophie for our  then  4 month old daughter  she absolutely loves it! we love sophie too because it is safe  non toxic  and so easy to clean! my baby will hold sophie and \"talk\" to her for hours  she doesn t interact with any other toy like this one  when it s nap time she must have sophie to hold onto  we will probably be buying a second sophie in case something tragic happens to the one we have!\n",

      " u'i was so looking forward to getting this for my little girl  but from the second i opened the box i was disappointed   it didn t smell like vanilla rubber; it smelled like latex   i don t get how it can be called a teether   it is a squeak toy   period   it is completely hollow and has an obnoxious squeak when you barely even touch it   it is so flexible that i don t see how a  it can be safe  which reading some of the other negative reviews i now see that it probably isn t safe  or b  can be effective   this thing gives at the slightest touch  so how can it possibly aid in cutting teeth or massaging the gums?additionally  you cannot sterilize this toy   so    let s see   my baby got thrush when she was only 2 weeks old and i had to sterilize everything that came in contact with her mouth   what would i have done with this then?  and she just got over her first cold  so again everything was sterilized   you need to sterilize things with a baby  you just do   how can this be a toy that you can t sterilize?!?i will be going to barnes and noble tomorrow to compare and see if this is the same as what they have there  but either way i m sorely disappointed in this purchase   i ve bought dog toys that would have made better teethers   heck  i have a baby garanimals water toy giraffe that would be a safer and more effective teether   **i have two other toys by vulli and they do have the natural rubber smell   this is going back to amazon **'\n",
      " u'before i had my son my mind was made up to eventually buy sophie  today he is 4 months old and finally has her  my impression of her after opening the box is that she is bigger and more bulky than i had pictured and really would make a great dog toy  when my dogs hear her they think so too  my son seems to like her quite a bit  she is very easy for him to pass from hand to hand which he doesnt do with other toys  upon shoving her in his mouth for the first time he immediately removed her and stuck his tongue out like he was trying to make the taste go away  the expression was priceless  needless to say he still tries chewing on her though her head is way too big to fit in his mouth and seems to be his favorite part  at first i wondered why did i pay so much for this but i dont regret buying sophie at all '\n",
      " u'paint peeling off just a month later  i paid a lot of money for this overpriced dog toy  so i had hoped for better quality  especially with all the hype surrounding it  but my son loves it  so he will have his silly  blank giraffe for a while  i guess '\n",
      " u'this is a glorified dog toy  it feels like one  it squeaks like one  i thought it was something special from all of the good reviews but it is not  you can buy 3x the amount of good teethers for the price  honestly people were asking why my son had a dog toy '\n",
      " u'i ordered this teether because of all of the wonderful things that i had seen and heard  i was more excited to open it and see it that my 5 month old daughter was to use it  although she will play with it and chew on it every now and then  she seems just as interested in it as she is with all of her other teething toys  i am still waiting for her to fall in love with it  i didn t mind the price  because most good teethers run around the $12 18 range and nothing is too much as long as my baby is happy  maybe when she gets to the painful teething stage  she will use it more  for now  i think this teether is just overrated '\n",

      " u'after getting this for my baby and after she sucked a good amount of the paint off i read that amazon s sophie s were fake   i scoured the internet looking for ways to distinguish the real sophie s from the fakes   i found that this sophie had the right markings  no obvious mistakes and came with one of the right lot or batch number so i chalked up the running eye paint to it being natural   but then i saw sophie s in a local children s retail store and i realized mine was fake after all!  the real sophie s eyes do not smear when rubbed or sucked on   the real sophie was slightly more slender and toned looking   she was more flexible  you can easily fold her over and squeeze her cheeks in making her squeak with very little pressure  just tapping her on the body while she is laying down makes her squeak  whereas the fake sophie is slightly stiffer so you have to deliberately squeeze her to make her squeak  do not take the chance with these  find a local retailer through their official site  not a fake sophie website and order through them!  www vulli toys com is the site on the box   hope this helps!'\n",
      " u'my baby loved sophie but after reading on vulli website certain batches have been recalled in june 2013 due to high levels of toxicity by the german manufacturer  i would not give this to your child   not worth taking a chance since baby puts this in mouth   '\n",

      " u'i bought this toy for my daughter and she never really liked it that much  it was ok  but she did not favor it over any of her other toys  she was a late teether  getting her first two teeth at almost a year old  so that may be why  sophie stopped squeaking after a few months of light use  although my daughter was not crazy about it  her baby friend picked it up on a play date and loved it  just like so many other things  this is another thing that i think some babies adore and others could care less about  i found out my child prefers frozen waffles as teethers!'\n",

      " u'i bought this for my teething 6mo old  all the reviews were great  however  i didn t realize that it squeaks  if you don t mind listening to it all the time  then it would probably be great to teeth  i didn t even let her see it  so i have no idea if she would have liked it  it did smell like a plastic dog toy and like i said  it squeaks! i have no idea why this toy would cost so much  not worth it  in my opinion  i returned it right away  i guess i ll stick to the gel and wood teethers for my little one l'\n",
      " u'bought this when my son was about 8 months  now at 21 months he plays with every once in a while  he likes to hit it with things to make it squeak but that s about it  it did have a strong rubber smell and still does  also if you make the same mistake as me and wash it and get water in it  try putting it in your car on a hot day so water evaporates ; '\n",

      " u'it is a very simple toy  when i open the box  it just depressed me a lot  why spend 22$ buying this little plastic toy?'\n",
      " u'after reading endless reviews on this thing  i finally decided to dish out the money for this toy  once i got it in the mail  i was already a little disappointed   it looks just like a rubber dog toy you buy from petsmart  squeaks like one too  i still wanted to try it out because i was desperate to find something to help alleviate my son s teething pain  but the dog was more interested than he was  it didn t seem to help him  i just wanted to share this for the moms on here who are willing to buy anything to help with their baby s teething pain  this isn t the toy  my son likes a cold pacifier  the silicone raspberry teether  costs only $4  or even the tip of his baby spoons better than this thing  it certainly shouldn t be amazon s #1 baby item '\n",
      " u'baby has not interest in this teething toy  not sure why  wasted money on this one  too bad  don t emerse in water though cuz  water will get stuck inside  keep it away from bathtub '\n",
      " u'i bought sophie because of all the hype  and after buying the cheaper vanilla vulli teething rings  my baby loves those  i thought sophie would be like that  only larger  it s not at all like that  it s basically a very overpriced dog toy  my baby plays with it sometimes  but certainly doesn t seem to prefer it over her other  much cheaper  teethers  i could have bought four of those for the cost of this one  my fault for being swayed by hype '\n",
      " u'my child has not really been that entertained by this   everyone told me  you have to get sophie!  but i think it is just an overpriced squeaky toy that my child has mostly ignored '\n",
      " u'this teether is adorable and my 4 month old loves it but be warned that it is much like a dog toy with a squeaker   if you have a dog that likes squeaker toys you may want to think twice before purchasing this as the dog will likely want to make it his own '\n",
      " u'it s really terrible  when my 4 months daughter started to chew it i just found that the rubber was peeling off     so scary  i returned it to amazon right away '\n",
      " u'i thought it would sound but the sound hole of the teether did not work  when i got the teether why do my vulli sophie the giraffe teether not a voice!'\n",
      " u'my daughter likes it but one time i did notice the white rubbing off when it was wet but i have not seen it rub off anymore'\n",
      " u'very disappointed upon arrival  it resembles a $20 00 dog toy  paint is already pealing off  save money and buy a real one '\n",
      " u'i don t understand what all the rave about this toy is bought it for my son and he could not be less interested than he is it tastes kind of rubbery and the squeak is loud and startles him  not to mention its the same exact squeak that dog toys have  so my dog [who s name is also sophie] thinks its hers the colors are not as vibrant as the ones on his other toys so he overlooks this when he s got a pile to choose from '\n",
      " u'my 7 1/2 month old grandbaby was sittng up teething on her beloved sophie  she fell forward  as she does constantly  on her tummy  usually  this just means more playing and crawling! she was kicking her feet  as usual  facing away from me and i thought her body movement looked strange  i grabbed her up and sophie s right front leg was jammed down  her throat and had completely blocked her breathing!!! as soon as i removed it  she was gasping for air and thankfully began to scream  sophie is her favorite toy and ours until now! children should not be unattended with sopie!'\n",
      " u'i don t understand the fuss with these tethers  we went through 3 just to give it the benefit of the doubt  the paint came off easily on all of them  you can t wash them as water gets inside so it gets ruined  i say it s a waste of money  too expensive '\n",
      " u'i can t believe how much is being charged for this silly thing  if you re wondering what the big deal is about this giraffe  i ll tell you  it s nothing it s an over priced trend it s no different than a squeaky dog toy if you get water in the squeaky hole you can expect mold to grow  lame '\n",
      " u'my baby enjoys this toy but the loud squeak has woken him up when he squirms around in his crib during naps  also  the dishwasher leaves strange dark bruises on it  not our top favorite  the vulli vanilla teething rings are better '\n",
      " u'this teether is very cute  good quality  however my son still prefers my car keys than this  it s very unfortunate  coz i love it!'\n",
      " u'my little guy likes sophie but he definitely could have lived without it   personally i wouldn t have bought it if i didn t have a coupon but since i did i figured i d give it a shot   he doesn t use it as a teether so much as he likes to just squeak her '\n",
      " u'i wanted to love this product and was excited to buy it when i became pregnant but am now hesitant to let my baby use it after reading about the recall in europe  apparently  as i understand it  their toxin standards of measurement are lower than ours so they have not been recalled here  apparently we are ok with low levels of nitrates in the toys our children put in their mouths  but europeans are not   hmmm    be that as it may  toxins registering even close to a dangerous level made me nervous about using  after digging around online i did discover that the company claims to have changed the product after a certain date and lists manufacturing codes so you can check yours  those listed were made after a certain date and are said to be safer   sadly mine was not made after the &#34;improved&#34; date but i could not return it because there was no formal recall in our country  i considered returning it and hunting for one with an approved manufacturing date but man that was just too much work  bummed but not ready to take a risk with my baby '\n",
      " u'i can t make a negative review on this  as my son just didn t take to this   i was trying to make this my solution to a pacifier  but he just didn t care about it   my dogs  however  seemed to think it was theirs  because of the squeaking  something i didn t think about before purchasing   so  just a bit of advice  if you have dogs that like squeaky toys  just be careful!'\n",
      " u'had to give it away without a chew  good quality but no baby of mine wanted to put it anywhere near his or her mouth  never quite recovered from bing submerged in water as well '\n",
      " u'my 5 month old daughter  for all the great reviews   did not like it! so its all subjective to the baby s   likes   and dislikesshe actually prefers chewing on her bibs and so as long as shes happy  i m very happy! she likes the squeeze toy noise it makes   but that only captures her attention briefly    but really  that s not why i bought this and spent this money for '\n",
      " u'i liked that sophie was 100% natural rubber and safe for my twins to chew   they did not  however  favor it over other toys to chew and therefore it was not worth the price   i did like the smell  though; it reminded me of toys when i was a kid '\n",
      " u'totally overpriced for what it is   go to petsmart and get a squeaky toy for $ 99   my 7 month old doesn t even like it   she wants her $2 rattles instead   this thing is totally useless   don t waste your money!'\n",
      " u'received a fake one  paint on the giraffe started peeling off  it was sold by &#34;sb natural products&#34; and fulfilled by amazon '\n",
      " u'kept her attention for a couple days   then stayed at the bottom of her toy pile   i think i ll give it to my dog '\n",
      " u'the squeeze sound are way too loud which scared my son a couple time  maybe it will work fine outdoor  but my son did not really like it '\n",
      " u'this is a cute item  however  the box arrived and it was crushed and looked used   it was intedned as a gift so very embarrassing to have it look like a regift'\n",
      " u'i had never seen one of these before and it was a bit of a let down in person   it is basically a french dog toy  baby chews on it sometimes  but she doesn t seek it out   when i offer it to her she sometimes will take it and other times tosses it away  i d say she is also unimpressed  not worth the money  i appreciate that it is natural rubber and not made in china  but there is not much to it for $20 '\n",
      " u'received this today  my son enjoys it and the product is as described  but in my opinion it is an overpriced dog toy '\n",
      " u'received the product and smells like cheap rubber  this is biggest waste of money  i even soaked it in hot water with soap for couple of hours  over a couple of days  but still smells  i ended up tossing this as this was waste of money '\n",
      " u'i know everyone loves this thing  but we took it away from my son when he was 3 months old because all of the paint was rubbing off and showing up on his face and in his mouth   just by gently rubbing the body of this thing with your finger will cause the paint to come off in little rolls   maybe  the paint is ok to eat  but why risk your baby eating rubber and paint if he doesn t have to   we are sticking to cloth and wooden toys '\n",
      " u'i went back and forth for months on deciding if i wanted to buy this product for my son  but because of the overwhelming positive reviews on both amazon and various mommy blogs i decide it was worth the unjustly price tag  i took it out and it was small  flimsy  smelled like latex  and the squeak called my dog over from the other room  i quickly realized that i was paying so much not because it is  natural   which is a meaningless word anyhow  not because it is bpa free  but simply because it is imported from france  im giving it an okay review because my kid seems to like it  not love it  but he likes to gnaw on it once in a while  it is very overprice  seriously'\n",
      " u'i bought this for my 12 month old daughter   it s good quality but she had absolutely no interest in it   after a few weeks of giving it to her occasionally and squeezing it  trying to put it in her hands  etc  we put it into storage   i just gave it to my niece for her 1st b day so we ll see how she likes it '\n",
      " u'when i ordered sophie i was excited that it was suppose to do sooooo much for pleasing my grandson  well  he doesn t use it  the squeak does nothing to get his attention and for what you pay for it  it s not worth the money  with all the hype  i thought sophie would have been a wonderful teether  but there are many other things that pleases him more that i should have purchased instead  the teeting rings are easier for them to hold and feel good on the gums  when cold  keep your money and get the colorful rings you can place in the freezer  your child or grandchild will be much happier '\n",
      " u'i think this toy is so cute and i have tried so hard to make it a favorite of my daughter after spending about 20 dollars on it  she ll bite on it for a minute if i hold it up for her  but she will drop it after a few seconds and go to another toy  it was such a highly rated toy that i thought i would give it a shot despite the high price  but i would have to say it was not worth it with how much my daughter uses it '\n",
      " u'someone gave this giraffe toy to my son shortly after he was born  from the first days he began grasping things  he s loved it  he s now 8 months old and still enjoyed playing with it up until recently when i took it away  unfortunately  sophie the giraffe has lost most of her spots and most of the brown paint from her feet and head  i m guessing that a lot of this paint has been eaten by my son  i m not overly nervous or sensitive about him chewing on his toys  but this possible paint digestion from a plastic toy bothered me  i wouldn t give it as a gift to anyone '\n",
      " u'my daughter loves sophie  but we received her as a gift from amazon  upon purchasing another one  we discovered the one from amazon was a fake  the squeaker broke  no blush on cheeks  rough surface  paint peeling off  and legs were not smooth and had pits/divots etc  sad that someone is doing this  but don t buy here til amazon resolves  also  please monitor your child while they are using sophie  the legs are a choking hazard '\n",
      " u'the packaging made the item look of decent quality   however  immediately after opening the box  the item exuded a potent  cheap plastic odor   after several washings  the odor remained   the quality of the item seems very poor  and is constructed much like a very cheap pet toy   it immediately went back into the box and i ve just printed out the amazon return label   i can t believe how many good reviews this item received  which is largely how we base our purchases '\n",
      " u'my grand daughter had this teether  she loved it until i noticed the paint coming off  i took it away immediately  so it sits on the shelf  what a waste of money  i never saw a teething toy that had the paint come off in my life  i hope it was not toxic  maybe it would make a good dog toy '\n",
      " u'i received this as a baby shower gift  i had put it on my registry  due to all the good reviews  i m a first time soon to be parent  when i pulled it out of its fancy box  i could already see the paint coming off of the cheeks and ears of the giraffe  when i rubbed the cheeks with my thumb  more paint came off  i can t imagine the paint won t come off when chewed on by a child  i m not sure if i ll give it to my baby once he is born  i don t want him chewing and ingesting the paint  it s not worth $17  it s dollar store quality '\n",
      " u'i bought this teether/toy for my daughter when she was about 4 or five months old and she just never took it   she did play with for a few days but just to make it squeak   she was never interested in it as a teether for some reason   i paid about $20 for this too  so i was pretty sad that i spent so much for a teether and it basically just went in the toy bin never to be used   i would offer it to her often but she just wasn t interested '\n",
      " u'wow  that is my one word summary  originally i had hoped to recieve this very cute toy for my baby girl at her shower  and then i actually got it and realized  with dismay and irritation  that is has a squeeky toy right in the belly! here i was enjoying the company of family and friends cooing over our new bundle when my older  nine year old  daughter pulled it out of the pile of gifts and started squeeking it repeatedly  i really wish it would have said in the product discription that it squeeked   i would never have asked for it  it does sound just like a dog toy! i had to do surgery and now sophie has a hole on her side  but you live and learn   i should have asked for the baby food puree book instead!'\n",
      " u'do not leave your baby unsupervised with this toy! i was doing tummy time with my five month old son and he got the leg of the giraffe down his throat and was choking on it!! if i had not been right there  he could have died  he loves this toy so i won t take it away  i just won t let him have it when he s laying on his belly and he definitely won t be playing with it without an adult right there  i ll be contacting the manufacturer   especially since i see other reviews on here with the same story! scary  other than that major flaw  this is a great toy  the squeaker squeaks really easily  perfect for babies  and the rubber is very soft  but still durable  '\n",
      " u'this is the most expensive chew toy i ve ever purchased  for twenty something dollars i was expecting this to be a nice sturdy teether  the paint came off in my sons mouth  it was filthy in minutes  not at all was i was expecting from a product with such rave reviews new moms & first time moms beware '\n",
      " u'i am very angry to find out that this teether having serious painting issues  and more surprisingly  it is different from the one selling in store at baby r us!  i bought this for my baby 3 months ago when he was 6 months old   however  pretty soon after i got it  i found the painting on the giraffe s head and legs was peeling off   so i stopped giving it to my baby   and just recently i saw a discussion online and a bunch of moms all complained the painting issue with this teether   and guess what?  they all bought it from amazon!  one mom pointed it out that the product she got from amazon looks totally different from the one she bought from bru   and she had no painting problem with the one from bru  so i went to bru store and checked it out myself   and i was angry to see it was true!  the giraffe selling in bru is light pink comparing to the brown color i bought form amazon   i won t say the one on amazon is fake   but i won t recommend to buy it on amazon  after spending so much money!'\n",
      " u'i didn t realize that this teether squeaks  i m sure the reviews mention it  but i didn t even look into it  since everybody has one of these  the squeak is particularly bad since our dog thinks it s a toy for her  and who can blame her   our 5 month old hasn t really enjoyed this teether so far  but maybe that will change as he gets older  at this point  i wouldn t recommend it '\n",
      " u'here is a link of one recall in germany [   ]it has information of what and where the number should be on the leg the new and safe sophie with the help of the batch number  which is printed on the inside of sophie s left leg  the sophies with the following batch numbers are definitely safe:321230321300322090322105the reason i have three stars is that i haven t bought a sophie yet for my son so i can t rate it poorly or great but i am now reconsidering '\n",
      " u'added this teether to my cart last minute and really should have read a little closer  i thought i was ordering the harder rubber teether they offer  so i was surprised when i opened the box and this one was soft and squeaky  i love this company s products but could not bring myself to keep this product because it reminded me too much of a squeaky toy for my dogs  the squeaker was also quite loud which i could imagine wearing on my nerves in a very short amount of time  a relative of mine had a baby not too long ago  so i decided to give this to them rather than keep it for myself  i have to say  i felt kinda bad giving it to them when i saw their two year old \"in action\" squeaking their younger sibling s new teether  hopefully when the baby is enjoying it  the toy won t be quite as obnoxious '\n",
      " u'i got one of these as a showe gift that my baby loves  i wanted to buy another and saw it on amazon for $19  what a deal considering these are normally $25  so i ordered and am not sure if it s the same and if the one from amazon is authentic i realize these are hand painted so there will be variation  but the rubber on the new one smells different and feels slightly harder than my original one  there are also some rough spots on the amazon one whereas there were no rough spots on my original one at all as you could plainly tell it was very high quality  the sqeaker is not the same in the two versions  when you press on it to feel it  the shape of the squeaker is different shape  size  and sound  my original one squeaks better  the one from amazon doesn t squeak well  and is higher pitched  the serial number font size on the two are different  the original one had a larger font size and the amazon has a smaller font size  the most notable difference is the feet/hooves  the original one is thicker rubber and pretty even in thickness all the way around  the amazon one is thin  very thin at some parts  you can see the think  wavy  crepiness  like the baby can chew through it and the hooves are not the same shape as the one i already have i don t know  i bought this from  amazon  but it is fulfilled by an outside vendor and i don t know their reputation  since this is something that can easily be counterfeited  i am going to return this and buy it at full price form a store i trust  like nordstrom  it is worth the hassle for me because this is an item that my baby constantly has in her mouth and is sucking/chewing on also  mine came in horrible packagin and the box is totally mangled and destroyed and some of the paint on the toy is rubbed off  not your typical amazon quality if you ask me '\n",
      " u'we recently received a present of this toy  my 6 month old daughter loves it and while playing with it almost choked only my husband was so close to her  the distribution company passed it off as \"gagging\" rather than \"choking\"     unbelievable  i am shocked to read so many similar stories    it is time to do something about this before something dreadful happens '\n",
      " u'one of the little horns had a whole in it on the top so i don t feel i can let my daughter chew on it in fear more of the plastic will come off and she will swallow or choke on it '\n",
      " u'my daughter is going through some major teething right now  pre molars   so i thought i d see if sophie lived up to the hype  my daughter chews on everything right now  so i thought it d be perfect  perhaps we got her too late in the game  she s 17 months old   but she doesn t care about sophie  she doesn t like that it squeaks  and she doesn t seem to like the taste  which is basically just a rubber taste  this is just a glorified dog toy '\n",
      " u'when i ordered sophie i was under the impression she would be vanilla scented as i had seen her in stores   i was unaware that this item also came in a natural rubber scent   i feel as if they could have written it a little more clearly before i ordered this item   the rubber smell is not a terrible smell  but time will tell if my baby enjoys chewing on a rubber smelling toy vs  a vanilla scented toy '\n",
      " u'seen many children with this product so decided to purchase one for my child  noticed that when my child was sucking on the head of the giraffee the colouring on the eyes was coming off and it was all around my child mouth  i didn t expect that to happen!'\n",
      " u'after all the 5 star reviews of the vulli  i ordered this  i am an enthusiastic  older first time mom  after 4 years of infertility  meaning  i spare no expense on my daughter  but this was truly a waste of money  there are hundreds of other teethers that are far better construction  function  delight  etc  what a disappointment  the one salvation was that its cute  but for 20 bucks?!! a lot of overpriced nostalgia '\n",
      " u'this children s toy is nostalgic and very cute  however  there is a distinct rubber smell and a very odd taste  yes i tried it  that my baby did not enjoy  also  if it is soiled it is extremely difficult to clean as the rubber is a kind of porus material and does not clean well  the final thing is the squeaking device inside which stopped working after the first couple of days  i returned this item feeling i had overpaid for a toy that was defective and did not meet my expectations  please do not be swayed by the cute packaging and hype surounding it as i was  one more thing  i was given a full refund from amazon without any problem '\n",
      " u'so after much debate about spending this insane amount on a teething toy   i went ahead and bought it    the reviews were great and my friends raved about it   however my son is not interested at all in this toy   we have owned it for probably 4 months now and he has played with it a handful of times   for me this was not worth the $ at all   my little one is much happier chewing on the drawstring knot attached to my hoodie or playing with his books'\n",
      " u'ok     so i have heard so many wonderful things about sophie   i had a hard time justifying paying twenty dollars for a rubber toy but hey   if it is a &#34;must have&#34; then i guess i must get it   so i buy and receive sophie and  although it resembles a dog toy  give it to my 7 month old daughter   she is interested in it for a whole five minutes then is on to the next thing bottom line: yes   it s cute   yes it s easy for little hands to hold     but it is worth the high price?'\n",
      " u'just so you know this does squeak  i missed that when i was purchasing this  so it is very loud and squeaky   the baby likes it and loves to chew on the legs and head '\n",
      " u'i was so excited when i finally ordered this product   i had been wanting to get the vulli sophie giraffe for months   i read many reviews and most all were great reviews   my son loved the giraffe   all was good with this fantastic teether until he decided to chew on the feet   the legs of the giraffe are long enough to go all the way to the back of a baby s mouth causing choking   he was using this product when he was 4 5 months old   if he had been older  he may have been able to pull the giraffe out of his mouth by himself   so  the $20 teether has been sitting in a drawer ever since   i am considering buying a different vulli teether because i did like the product   it s bpa free and a natural rubber   for future purchases i will be avoiding giraffes  the long legs are cause for concern '\n",
      " u'as other people have posted  this sophie is fake!  i didn t realize it until i compared it to one my friend bought from the big named toy store at the higher price   her sophie was more colorful  softer and colorfast   my \"sophie\" was already starting to show the colors running  and had a tougher feel to the rubber   do not buy this one!!'\n",
      " u'i purchased sophie for my 18 month old son  my first impression when i opened sophies box was that she was a dog toy retailed for babies! she looks  smells and squeaks just like a dog toy! however  my son seemed to take to her right away  i got her just yesterday and i don t think he s been anywhere without her in his hand  she s very soft  and is supposed to be 100% natural which is a big plus for me! there are some downfalls to sophie though  for instance she can cost anywhere from 15 20 dollars and for something so closely related to  a dog toy thats quite a lot! also she does have a very potent rubber smell when you first get her  it gets better with a few washings  but is still there  also she is unfinished  when i say that i mean that there is no clear coat on her and she is not shiny  which i expected being as she is supposed to be a natural product  however she is very porus  thus anytime she is dropped or your child has grubby fingers she gets very dirty because the rubber holds onto the dirt  she does come clean with some soap and water  but i find myself washing her constantly! overall i think its a pretty good product and am very happy my son likes it  but i don t think i would spend the money on it again '\n",
      " u'i think most of the people overrated sophie  my son shows no interest in this teetering at all  he actually likes to grab it and bang it  and the price is wayyyyyyyy too expensive  i wont recommend it '\n",
      " u'when we first got it i thought did my fianc&eacute; buy this for the dog? why did i think that?  because it squeaks just like a dog toy  feels like a dog toy  and when the dog heard it squeak she thought it was hers to  yes it is cute and i am sure good for teething but for 20 dollars it is a bit pricy for something that honestly isn t all that different from a dog toy  i would rather have spent the 20 doallrs on a couple other more interesting teethers   btw: this is written by the mom not the dad '\n",
      " u'for about a month  month 6  this was his favorite chew toy  now it just sits collecting dust  there s no denying that there s something about the material that attracts infants  it s just a shame that it didn t last very long at all  if i had to do it all over again  i d probably buy the cpg chan which looks striking similar to a nipple  i m not about to shell another ~$15 on a rubber chew toy that probably costs a fraction of the amount to produce  i should also note there are a couple of undesirable features that you should be aware of with regards to this product  first  be very careful when you wash this thing  if you accidentally get some water in the squeaker it s very hard to dry out fully which makes it rather unsanitary  secondly  i found the odor of the toy to be a little more petroleum like than i would like  my son never got sick or anything but it was hard to ignore the scent of the toy '\n",
      " u'i was very excited about this product and really only purchased it because of how many good reviews it has received  but i m afraid to say that my 9 month old son barely looked at it twice  he was actually scared of it at first  but got over that after a little while  and just chose to ignore it completely  he had been chewing on everything and teething terribly  so i was very hopeful  i will say he may just be too old  and if i had introduced something like this when he first started teething at 4 months it may have turned out differently '\n",
      " u'i just purchased a sophie for my 6 month old son after liking the one i saw at my sister s house  while mine looks the same  it is far more sensitive as a squeak toy than my sister s is!! i am not a fan of super noisy  annoying toys  so i m less than thrilled that this one squeaks loudly if you so much as bump it   the one that my sister has must be squeezed very hard to make a noise   not so with mine the rubber is great   i like everything else about it   but i wish i could figure out a way to disable the squeaker '\n",
      " u'i registered for this teether and got it at one of my baby showers  it is so cute! it looks like a vintage toy   the only problem is the squeaker inside it  i m pretty sure if my son bit down on this  he d have permanent damage to his hearing  it is uncomfortably loud for me to squeeze at a few feet from my face  i wanted to love sophie  but i ll go with a less cute teether '\n",
      " u'although my son love sucking face with sophie  i got a used one on craigslist that has now been through 2 kids and is just great   the recently purchased one from amazon though is a lighter color  slightly harder material  and splitting at the seams in 2 places after only being out of the box for 48 hours   my son is 3 months old and obviously did not do this   i tried contacting vulli with no response   i am very disappointed with the customer service and quality for such an expensive chew toy '\n",
      " u'this toy i do not like  they should make it a bit smaller  i think it is a little big for my daugther s hand  she was about 6 months when we got it and then water always gets in it '\n",
      " u'this is such a great product  unfortunately  it arrived in a very smashed condition sophie is unharmed but it s a gift so it looks pretty bad  just go to target and buy sophie in the store '\n",

      " u'all the moms in my moms  group got sophie for their babies so i wondered if there was something to the hype and got one too  my daughter loves sophie  kids really do love this thing  if we  heaven forbid  ever lost sophie i d have to run out and buy another one!'\n",
      " u'i was a little skeptical on whether sophie was going to be worth the money  but after it arrived today i am very happy that i bought her   my is almost 6 months old and is getting his two bottom teeth and he has not put her down all day   he even carried her in his hands for 20 minutes while i shopped with him in the bjorn   everything about this toy is wonderful   even the squeak is not like some of those annoying squeaker toys out there   if you are thinking about rather or not to buy sophie take it from me and buy her you will not be disappointed!'\n",
      " u'i have been reading about sophie and was going back and forth about whether to buy it for my little boy   he is seven months old and everything goes in his mouth   one of our friends gave him one last night for an early christmas present and our baby is already in love with sophie   he cannot get enough of chewing on her   the squeak is making our dog  a rhodesian ridgeback  a little jealous  so we re limiting playing with sophie to only in the pack and play   sophie was easy for baby to grab and perfect for our late teether '\n",

      " u'we got this just for my son to chew on instead of anything he could cram in his mouth  he loved the feel of it i guess  it s rubber but  a strange type of rubber unlike anything i had seen before  i even took a chew on it once just to see what the fuss was about  it was slightly harder than i though it would be but clearly soothing to his little sore gums it washed up easily but never really seemed to get &#34;dirty&#34; although it likely never even seen any dirt  today it looks as new as we got it although some of the paint has worn off which is fine because its non toxic '\n",
      " u'this product is without a doubt the best on the market  i have bought so many teethers and this is the only one my son likes  he mainly chews on her legs  but loves to just hold her as well  she works for teething and simply a toy  i would recommend this product to any and everyone  infact i am going to buy a few more and give them as shower gifts  the inexpensive price is a plus :  just beware if you have a dog  she squeaks so puppies think she belongs to them : !!!'\n",

      " u'yes  it s expensive   but it works and it s cute   who cares when my son gnaws on sophie and stops fussing due to teething pain?!  you can t fully wash it  immerse it in water  because water gets into the body  but you can easily sponge it down with soap  so it s all good   love it  but more importantly  my son loves her '\n",
      " u'the product is what i wanted and expected  however  the original box was dusty  almost torn; as though it was a used product  it seemed very odd to me  i paid for a new product and expected to receive the product and box in such conditions '\n",

      " u'sophie is pretty much the only teether my son cares for  i have to admit  i was a little skeptical when i ordered sophie  but she really is worth the money  knowing that your child is chewing on a toy that is completely safe  justifies the price  when the description said \"soft\"  i was thinking like foam like but it s a very soft plastic  it s easy to hold on to for my 4 month old  he loves to chew on sophie s legs  we take her everywhere with us!'\n",
      " u'i love this giraffe  i think it is so cute  i thought it was a little expensive at first  but bought it anyway  it is very durable  my daughter used to chew on it when she was teething now she is 17 months and still plays with it on occasion  she can make it squeak now and she likes that '\n",
      " u'our son refuses to take a paci  but loves to chew on things  we have had a hard time finding anything that keeps him interested for more than a few minutes  that isn t paper  but this sophie has worked wonders! we first saw this at a friend s baby shower and i originally thought it was a dog s chew toy  but our son loved it so much i had to track one down  as expensive as it is compared to other teethers  for us it was well worth the purchase! the squeaker in side keeps him happy for longer periods of time than other teethers and the long legs and neck give him something to easily grip or chew on  perfect!'\n",

      " u'i bought sophie for my 4 month old granddaughter who is showing signs of teething  dispite her limited ability to grasp toys  sophie s design fits easily into her tiny hands and quickly has become our families go to toy to comfort her in her fussiness  a commonly heard phrase in our home is &#34;where s sophie?&#34;'\n",
      " u'i ordered the two pack for two different grandbabies who will be born soon   each giraffe came in its own box which was helpful since they were separate gifts   it is amazing how popular this toy is with teething babies   those soft legs must feel just right on those tiny gums '\n",
      " u'you can t go wrong with sophie  i ve never met a baby who didn t like this toy  product arrived on time and as described '\n",
      " u'our son really likes sopie   the problem is that with every smile he has from her squeaker  so too are our dogs summoned to sophie   at which point they try to be sneaky and steal her   i know that there will be one morning that i forget to put her out of reach and they ll swiftly tear her apart   but this is the price we pay for having 4 legged and 2 legged children   my son enjoys this toy for the squeaker and due to the ease at which he can hold it   his small mouth  4 months old  has some difficulty chewing on her   he chews her ears  but i think he wishes they were a little bigger so he could get them further back  if they made a bunny rabbit it would be perfect for him    i considered getting the smaller sophie teether  but i figured that he could grow into this one   overall  it s a good purchase and i know our son will be searching out sophie among his other toys '\n",
      " u'i m not sure why sophie is such a hit with the little ones  but my 7 month old baby girl is one of her adoring fans   the rubber is softer and more pleasant to handle  and my daughter has enjoyed chewing on her legs and the nubs on her head even before she started teething   she also loves the squeak that sophie makes when you squeeze her   not sure what it is but if sophie is amongst a pile of her other toys  my daughter will more often than not reach for sophie   and i have the peace of mind of knowing that only edible and safe paints and materials have been used to make sophie  as opposed to bright starts and other baby toys made in china   now that the research is out on phthalates and other toxic substances in baby toys  i think it s more important than ever to find good quality toys that are also safe for our babies to handle and put in their mouths   sophie is a must have for every new mom in my opinion   even if your kid is one of the few that can take or leave her  it s worth a try   vulli  the makers of sophie  also make natural rubber teething rings that my daughter loves as well '\n",
      " u'i got this for my baby shower before our little guy was born  he has loved it since he was about 2 months old  when he was very little he loved to hear the squeak that sophie makes and he liked to watch her dance  we were making her dance   when he started teething at 4 months  and continuing to now when he is a year  this has worked so much better for him than teething rings  he shoves one of her foot/legs into whatever corner of his mouth is hurting and starts chomping  the rings only work for the front of babies mouths  sophie can fit in all corners!! sophie is a bit more expensive than most teethers but she has a lot going for her  she is made of all natural rubber  from france  no risk of china getting lead into this lady!   super sturdy  and still entertains my one year old! the price here on amazon is also better than you can find practically anywhere '\n",

      " u'this little sophie has so many angles to it and is so soft and managable by the littlest baby   one of the first things they coordinate   it also is a soft teething toy and very durable   i highly recommend sophie as a gift or accessory to the main gift '\n",

      " u'i almost gagged when my wife showed me the price but my little guy loves it   the texture on it is great and it has proven very durable   the squeaker in it has suffered all kinds of abuses and it is still going strong   hands down the best teether we have used '\n",
      " u'we have found sophie to be a much better teether once my son got older and started working on back teeth  he wasn t interested much when he was little but now that he s two it s great when those back teeth are bugging him   gives him something to provide a little relief other than gnawing holes in a binky '\n",

      " u'let me just start off by addressing the choking \"issue\" i keep reading about  please don t leave your child unattended with this toy  or most toys   and you won t have to worry about choking   i m pretty sure the instructions probably say that  but in this case it s especially important  i can see how the back legs could get wedged but the long legs are why baby loves it so much!moving on  hubby was way skeptical about putting this on our registry  and then buying it when no one purchased it for us    he said \"that had better be one magical toy\"   and now he admits that it is  and that it was worth the money our little guy adores his sophie  and it was one of the first toys he could hold onto and chew on  starting when his chewing obsession began around 2 months   now  at almost 9 months  he s still chewing away  and also adores playing \"peekaboo\" with sophie  when she squeaks just out of sight  and then appears my only  very minor  complaints are that 1  it can be a bit of a dirt attracter because of the material  as are the other silicone type teethers  not just specific to sophie    2  if you have a dog  they may think the toy is theirs   we can t send sophie along to the babysitter s house because her dog goes nuts overall  a must have baby item   no question '\n",
      " u'great product the baby smiled right away when she saw it  she started to chew on it right away and love the squeak noise it makes '\n",
      " u'i loved reading the story that comes with sophie  about how this toy is made just as it was in 1956  in the same process from the same all natural materials  tree sap or natural rubber    i have tried dozens of teether toys with both my daughters  my 5 month old loves chewing on sophie s feet or head  she smiles when i squeak her  if i give her one of the wooden teething toys she cries  too hard and big/heavy  and if i give her the plastic rings  she also cries  again i think too hard   sophie is amazingly soft and seems very durable  i have not seen any fading of the colors at all  wonderful toy  worth the price '\n",
      " u'well i never used it because i haven t teethed in quite some time  i sent it to my niece who i only see a couple times a year   i think it either got lost in the million other toys or became a dog toy   it was pretty cute though   i hope she liked it  what do i care? she s a baby   she s not going to remember little sophie   but perhaps it made her feel better and now she won t go into the rest of her childhood with this nagging unhappiness hangover from infancy   who knows?  like the title says  nice giraffe   maybe i will get myself one '\n",
      " u'i wasn t sure about the cost of this teether  but it s well worth it  easy for my 5 month old to hold onto  squeaks but not too annoying '\n",
      " u'my mom in law bought sophie for my son when he was just starting to really chew on things  and we were hearing some pretty scary things about toys not made in the usa   she did some research and came across sophie and we are so glad that she did! while sophie doesn t come from the usa  we love the fact that she is 100% safe and natural  and my son loves to play with her  i also love how soft sophie is  my son tends to swing his toys around and when he s sitting on my lap i m usually in danger of being hit in the face with whatever he s holding  needless to say a soft toy is even better in my book! there s one last thing i want to comment on  i ve read reviews that said that sophie was a \"glorified dog toy\" or something to that effect  and i don t want to seem rude  but i think they re crazy! yes sophie does squeak   which my son didn t care about much at first but now he loves  but that s about as far as the comparison could go! if you want a quality teething toy for your child then look no further! sophie is adorable  soft  perfect for little hands  100% natural  and safe!!!!!!! definitely worth every penny!!'\n",
      " u'this is a great teething toy  he loves it and loves the squeaking  this is easy to grasp and handle  could not be more happier with the purchase of this item'\n",
      " u'i have given this as a gift several times and all the moms come back to me and rave about how awesome this teether is and that their child loved it! it does seem slightly pricey for what is really a plastic chew toy  but if it soothes your child it s worth it!'\n",
      " u'i was very skeptical and read all the  horror  stories of sophie being unsafe  but my daughter was having a hard time teething  so i bought it   my daughter loves sophie  i have no idea what it is  but she just gets the biggest smile when i pull her out   like others have said   i just use common sense with it  any toy can potentially be dangerous  i watch her with it and don t let her have it in the car where i cannot see what s going on   but she has never even come close to choking or having any sort of danger with this teether   it has definitely helped with her teething and i d recommend it to anyone '\n",
      " u'at first my little guy wasn t sure about this thing and i was thinking i had wasted my money on what seemed like a dog sqeek toy    but once he figured out how to hold and chew on it   he now  loves it! we re in the early stages of teething so it goes where ever he goes!i have even gone as far as to put a pacifer clip around it s leg so that it doesn t get thrown on the floor in the car  i think this is the best teether out there  a must have for a teething kiddo '\n",
      " u'i think this teether has \"baby nip\" in it! my baby loves this teether  and this keeps her occupied in the car too! great product  must for a baby shower gift!!!'\n",
      " u'and it is!  sofie is soft  gnawable  and her belly sqeaks   my 4 5 month old son likes to gnaw her hooves  try to tear her legs apart  and gun her ears   sofie and a wubbanub  and peppa pig tv  make our lives so much easier '\n",
      " u'yes  it s imported  yes  it s expensive  and yes  i love it and so does my baby girl! this giraffe is made of natural rubber  it is so easy for my five month old to hold onto and to chew  she especially loves the legs  though she recently found the head and has begun to chew on sophie s ears  horns and mouth  sophie also makes a squeaky noise  my girl can chew on sophie for a long time and she doesn t get frustrated because it is so easy to stick sophie into her mouth  so far  this has been her favorite toy to chew on   i ve read some reviews where people say their children didn t like sophie   i think it s inevitable that some kids won t like sophie   but personally  i think it s worth a try   if your baby likes sophie  she will be a great toy   if not  hey  give sophie away to another mom to try with her baby   also  i think trying a toy over and over again may help   my little girl didn t quite get sophie right away at four months  but i kept putting sophie in front of her and encouraging her by sticking one of sophie s legs in her mouth   it took her a couple days  but once she understood she could chew away easily on sophie  she loved her!'\n",
      " u'my son absolutely loves this toy   he is able to chew on it for hours and loves that it squeaks when he bites it just right or hits it   it is soft and pliable but sturdy enough that it won t rip or wear out   he loves the many different angles of the toy because he can get the legs far back in his mouth or he can run his gums along the bumpy spine   this is an absolute must have for any baby who is teething   i never leave home without it '\n",
      " u'my little guy loves vulli  it s one of the only toys he can squeak   much to the dismay of my dog    he just started really getting a grip on his toys and vulli seems very easy for him to handle  bring to his mouth  squeak  etc '\n",
      " u'my daughter was given this toy as a gift for her baby from her sister   her baby has loved  this toy from the moment he learned to use his hands  when we lost it we immediately had to purchase another one  it is great for teething babies that are learning how to put things in their mouths  the only bad thing is the squeak sounds a lot like a dog toy   so if you have dogs that like squeaky toys they may mistake this for one of their toys!'\n",
      " u'my daughter loves this toy so much  she will drag it around the house everywhere she goes! she has so much fun playing with it '\n",
      " u'my baby absolutely loves sophie! even my three year old loves playing with her  i need to order another one '\n",
      " u'the teething giraffe worked great for my 7 month old son  yes it is expensive for a teether  but he loves it still and i do think it has helped him trhough this rough phase of his baby life!!'\n",
      " u'its the perfect size for small baby hands   its soft and light and easy for little ones to play with '\n",
      " u'sophie the giraffe is the best teether!  my son loves it and now i buy one for all my pregnant friends as shower gifts!  great!!!!'\n",
      " u'my daughter is 5 months and loves her sophie   the shape and size are perfect for her to grab and chew on   she loves that sophie squeeks   the only issue we have had is that the dog thinks it is her toy!'\n",
      " u'i got sophie for my baby girl when she was 3 months old  she absolutely loves her  chews everywhere: head  nose  ears  legs  satisfies her desire to chew & suck  she can independently hold this toy w/o difficulty  it is definitely her favorite toy!!'\n",
      " u'my daughter loves her sophie  we don t go any where with out it  got it when she was 3 months and now that she is 6 she loves it even more  will definitely recommend it  worth the money '\n",
      " u'i have this for my son i bought for my friend  s baby i  highly recommended but i don t know how to see real one or not i hope this is real one '\n",
      " u'i had one of these when i was a child  and bought one for my son   he loves it!!  the first moment out of the package he was reaching for it   now he chews on it all the time   the giraffe is made of soft plyable rubber that bends easy but doesn t tear/rip   it is perfect for little hands to grab onto   it wipes clean with a wet cloth or baby wipe   the coloring doesn t rub off   it is a great toy!'\n",
      " u'i have purchased several of these teethers for many baby showers   it is always well received and liked by the new baby '\n",
      " u'ever since my daughter received this is as a baby and loved it  i always get this for every one of my friends who has a new baby   it is adorable  and very easy to squeak   making it a joy for little babies to play with   amazon has the best price by far  this product has become very popular in stores and often sells for over $20! thank you amazon for always providing what i m looking for at a great price!'\n",
      " u'we were given this toy for our daughter when she was about three months old   she loved sophie instantly and even at 17 months she still plays with it   the legs are very soft  but still firm enough to help with a little one teething   though sophie has seen many hours of chewing she shows no signs of wearing out or coming apart   the only thing we have noticed is that the spots and hoof coloring did start to fade with chewing   all in all we loved getting this as it was something we would not have likely purchased on our own but have since gotten it for others for shower gifts '\n",
      " u'my daughter is four months old and is starting to teeth  i am one the buys off reviews and this toy has high ratings  so for the price i thought why not   when we fisrt received it i was all excited  we washed it and started to play with her with it   she won t have anything to do with it  i even tried to get her to \"chew\" on the legs  but to no avail   i ve noticed from day one it has a yucky rubbery smell to it  washed several times and can t get the smell to go away  the squeaker sounds just like a dog toy  my puppy goes nuts when we accidently hit it i will state the neck is perfect for her little hands to grab  and it goes with us in her toy bag every where we go    maybe someday she ll like it editing my review    my daughter is now 6 1/2 months old and sophie has become her one of her favorite toys     it still smells several washes later and my dog still goes nuts  but my baby loves it '\n",
      " u'this was the one toy our son just had to have all the time  it was excellent for teething  we buy this for every friend who has a baby  truly the best teether we could find and it s totally safe too '\n",
      " u'i purchased this for my 4 month old becasue he is teething  he loves it and will chomp on it all day! the squeeking one that i got him will make him laugh to as she is chewing it : '\n",
      " u'i bought this for my son when he was 5 months old   he loves it!!!!  he will spit out his pacifier to chew on sophie   i love knowing that it s natural and non toxic  and i have been raving about it to anyone who will listen!  i ll be giving this as a baby gift for anyone who is expecting!!'\n",
      " u'this teether is a perfect size and weight for a baby s little hands   it s soft and very flexible   because no part of it is very big in diameter  it s easy for my baby to grasp and hold on to without dropping it   the little squeak it makes is a cute addition '\n",
      " u'i thought my three month old daughter was too young for something like this   i was wrong   she loves it '\n",
      " u'we pulled it out of the package and  washed it off  and my 6 month old reached for it and started chewing!  this has been a great toy/teether for her and i am pleased with the product   it is very easy for her to hold   i gave it 4 stars because i do think it is quite expensive for a teething toy  but the product itself is great '\n",
      " u'soft  easy to grab for my 11 m old  he s disabled  so it was nice to find a toy that he could hang onto more easily than others  soothes his teething gums also  it s one of his favorite toys  if not his favorite only problem i have is that the ears look a bit worn  as if someone bought  used and returned it p s  don t rinse under water  it will stop squeaking  thankfully after wacking it several times  i got the microscopic amount of water dislodged  it squeaks just fine again  read instruction manual '\n",
      " u'i had never heard of sophie before i had a child   apprently the toy has been around for almost 50 years   my 4 month old loves her   i hesitated to spend so much on an infant toy over $20 including shipping    however this is really the only toy she plays with right now   i don t have a dog  but if you have one  the dog might mistake it for its own toy   to a human though  you can really tell that sophie is high quality '\n",
      " u'wife had to have this for our grandson   he loves it  and used if for his first tooth  i m sure it won t be the last thing we buy him'\n",
      " u'when we got home from playschool today  we had a package waiting by the door  it was sophie!! my daughter is 9 weeks old and until today she had no toys! i opened the box and held sophie in front of my baby  she stared intently at the cute little toy and her hands started to open and close i put sophie where baby could reach and she grabbed hold of her! perfect size for a baby toy and so soft! i can imagine it will be great when baby gets to teething too  i can see how some call it a glorified dog toy  but it is not made of the same stinky rubber as a dog toy and the paint on sophie is food grade  i think the price is a little high but we believe in only buying the kids a few well made quality toys rather than a bunch of cheap plastic junk '\n",
      " u'all my grandbabies love this toy  it smells good  and apparently tasts great  because they love to chew on it '\n",

      " u'i seriously wonder why my 3 month old is obsessed with this silly thing?!  it is seriously a dog toy!  she got 5 as gifts!!  but hey  she really likes it  so 5 stars it is!'\n",
      " u'my wife and i got this for our grandson and it worked like a charm during teething   he seemed to like it as a little toy friend  as well '\n",
      " u'definitely worth the money and stands up to all the hype  i still feel it is a little over priced for what it is  but my baby loves it and it was withstood a ton of chews :   i like that it s made of natural products and is easy to clean  my baby loves how it feels on her sore gums  would have given a 5 star review if it was a few dollars cheaper '\n",
      " u'i know i am late in reviewing this product   like 3 years late  i bought this before you could get it in in stores  now you see her everywhere  i still have this thing in my daughters room  and she is 3  she loved this thing so much that i can t get myself to get rid of her  everyone laughed at me  saying that i was giving my child a dog toy to chew on  if they had a teething baby then they would understand! like i said  both me and my daughter loved sophia'\n",

      " u'kids apparently love this little giraffe  it s cute and seems to work well for teething  from what i ve heard from moms   i still usually recommend frozen  stuff  to my patients  because from what feedback i have received  cold stuff feels really good on the sore gum tissue around erupting teeth   however  for those outings/trips when having frozen items is not an option  this seems like a good alternative  i ll probably buy one for my kiddo when the time comes '\n",

      " u'this is not just cute but my 4 month old smiles every time it squeeks  he started to grab things better now and love this one and of course the first thing is to get it in his mouth  love the giraffe neck because it give him the ability to hold it  very nice product!'\n",

      " u'we got this little giraffe as a gift from a friend who married a frenchman  i ve never heard of it before  but apparently it s a cultural icon of sorts in france  it is a neat little that helps babies with teething  motor skills and in all sorts of other little ways  sure enough  our baby new exactly what to do with it once he got a hold of little sophie  he started biting her and mauling her in the most savage ways imaginable  and sophie took all of it in stride without blinking an eye  literally  so far the toy seems well made and durable  i don t think that there is a material object known to man that can in a long run withstand everything that infants can do to it  but with that caveat in place i am very happy with the quality of this teething toy  would definitely recommend it to other parents out there '\n",

      " u'i received this as a baby shower gift and had never heard of it before  imagine my surprise when i see it s the #1 seller on amazon baby! my son didn t take much interest in it at all until 4 months or so when he started getting his first teeth  it is very easy for him to grasp and bring up to his mouth to chew on  he especially loves chewing on the feet  however it is not usually the toy he reaches for  and shows so much more interest in other things  i know many moms and babies love it  and it is very high quality  but i would have never payed for it myself  and the dog thinks it s a a dog toy because it squeeks  so that is just kind of gross '\n",

      " u'this is the best teething toy my kids have ever had   both of my boys gnawed on her much to their relief and mine i can t recommend sophie enough   she s durable  cute and she s a classic when my now 7 year old son was a baby  you could only get sophie in europe   thank goodness she made the trip buy two!'\n",
      " u'my wife found sophie and we ordered it  at first our son didn t know what to think of it  but a few hours later he was biting it and grabbing it and now he always looks for it and smiles when he sees it '\n",
      " u'as every mom knows  you always want to give your children the best you can   though i thought it was a bit expensive  i had read many good reviews about the vulli sophie giraffe teether and wanted to get one for my baby girl   and because sophie is made from all natural rubber and decorated with food grade coloring  i felt it would be worth the extra money to have the peace of mind knowing that there are no toxic paints  plastics  or dangerous small parts for my daughter to ingest   she has had an easy time teething  she has 2 lower center teeth with 4 coming in on top and 2 more on the bottom   but she still likes to chew on her little sophie giraffe   sophie s long skinny neck and legs are easy for my daughter s small hands to hold   my little girl loves to nibble on sophie s ears  horns  and feet   plus  i think this little giraffe is just so cute   also  just as an anecdote: when i first offered sophie to my daughter  she was not interested   the squeak was a bit loud for her  and the natural rubber taste was different for her   i thought i may have wasted $18   however  over time  my daughter has really come to like sophie   she will smile and reach for sophie when i offer it to her  and she seems to enjoy chewing on sophie   i am glad i bought this teether  and because it is gender neutral  i know i can use it in the future whether i have another girl or a boy '\n",
      " u'my 7 mo  nephew immediately started playing with and chewing on the teether  he seemed to prefer it over his many other christmas gifts  it was well worth the price  and his parents appreciated it as well '\n",
      " u'my daughter is 11 months old and she still loves sophie   it is one of the toys that i rotate in the car because my dog won t leave sophie alone if she is in the house   i also stick sophie in the diaper bag for a quick distraction   my daughter is working on her molars now and is able to stick sophie s legs way back in her mouth   you can put links around sophie s neck to attach her to the stroller   i smile every time i hear the little squeak coming from the backseat : '\n",
      " u'good size for my 5 month old to grab and chew  she loves it  i don t think all the packaging is really necessary though'\n",
      " u'i have tried other teethers with my five month old and she hates the taste of them   she loves chewing on sophie s face   gave it four stars instead of five because the legs are so close together it is hard for her to chew on them '\n",
      " u'my son loves teh giraffe  it is his favor toy to chew on  it is soft the baby can grab it very easily it makes a funny noice  great toy for every kid love it '\n",
      " u'this toy is worth every penny  my daughter loved this toy at 3 months and still adores it at 6 months  it is her favorite toy by far  the legs and neck are skinny enough that she can grasp it in her tiny hands  nothing heavy or hard that she can hurt herself with when she flails it around  the head and body squeak and make her laugh  great for teething  i always keep sophia in my diaper bag '\n",
      " u'i went back and forth for awhile deciding if i wanted to spend this much for something that is pretty much a dog toy  but i m glad i did  baby loves to stick the legs all the way to the back of his mouth to reach the back gums that pacis don t reach  and the squeek makes him laugh  the only complaints i have are that when i wash it it tends to hold water and is hard to get it all out  and the painted on spots and face are fading  i m guessing from washing it but if its going in the mouth its gonna be clean '\n",
      " u'i admit  i didn t get sophie the giraffe at first when my mom insisted i had to get it for my baby daughter   it was a fancy squeaky teether and that was that well  i get it now   babies love sophie   my baby loves sophie this little giraffe is absolutely darling   cute face  adorable spots  just one sweet package and the squeaking   this thing squeaks if you look at it hard enough  so my daughter loves to bite on the head  body  etc   the rubber is nice and soft and great for little gums my own complaint is the paint   no  i m not worried about it being harmful to my baby  but having purchased two different sophies  one at a store  one here on amazon  and having both fade eventually does cause me to frown   i get this is the nature of the dye  but it does keep this from being perfect '\n",
      " u'everyone on here was right  sophie is incredible  sophie can win a game of connect four in only three moves  when alexander bell invented the telephone he had 3 missed calls from sophie  seriously  our boy loves this thing  he enjoys chewing on it and she is the perfect size for his little hands '\n",
      " u'i was extremely skeptical about buying a $25 teething toy shaped like a giraffe  but since the price was around $17 here on amazon  i decided to give it a try  i m glad i did! i didn t want to believe it  but there is just something about this giraffe teether that babies love! i have a 6 month old  and my son loves chewing on sophie s head especially  he finds this toy scattered among his millions of other toys and totes it around the house when he s crawling around  still can t believe i spent $17 on it  but it was well worth it!'\n",
      " u'this teether is exactly what other reviews say   it is incredible   my 6 months old took to it right away   its the perfect shape to get those little hands around and perfect for gumming on   it s nice and soft and totally natural   we love it'\n",
      " u'my daughter loves this toy  she chews on it all day and it s nice to know that it is a safe toy  '\n",
      " u'i hesitated to buy this because it was such a high price for a simple toy  but after hearing so many great things  i decided to order for my little guy   he loves it!  it is one of his favorite toys  and was worth every penny!  i will definitely keep it in mind for friends family members who have babies   it would make a great gift '\n",
      " u'a really good quality one as what i ve expected   my 4 months nephew loves it very much as well! good buy as a gift!'\n",
      " u'my son  10 mths  loves his sofie the giraffe  we bought one in france while visiting relatives for about 8 euros at the grocery store  $[   ] seems a little expensive  [   ]'\n",
      " u'my 7mo son loves sophie!  it has lots of different shapes to chew on and it squeaks!  he s always quite proud of himself when he can make it squeak   = '\n",
      " u'i needed to purchase some newborn gifts for about 5x babies of friends and family   i purchased 5x sophie the giraffe teethers   the sophie giraffe products arrived in two days with my amazon prime account   the packaging was great and products arrived in mint condition   i gave the gift to each person and they were very thankful   some had heard about the product   one friend already had one sophie and was thankful to get another   the gifts were a hit '\n",
      " u'this is the 5th one i buy  it is now my signature gift for all expecting mothers  my kids loved it and i know everyone i have given it to loves it too '\n",
      " u'but there s a reason everyone loves sophie  it was the only toy my baby showed any interest in for about 2 months  it s perfect for teething  easily gripped and for some reason endlessly enjoyable to a newborn/infant we buy them for our pregnant friends now '\n",
      " u'is it worth it?  with so many inexpensive teethers on the market in all shapes and sizes  why is this one so popular?  yes  it s trendy   yes  the celebrities all have these for their babies   yes  it s european   but is it really worth the price for your baby?that s the question i ve been asking myself ever since receiving vulli sophie the giraffe as a gift from a well meaning  and much hipper than i am  friend   my answer is a qualified \"yes \"  here are the benefits   this teether is several inches tall  making it larger than many other teethers   also  it has a lot of appendages  four legs and a long neck    these features make it easy for my uncoordinated baby to hold on to this teether   that s a big benefit   also  the shape of the legs and head result in a variety of teething choices   my baby prefers to grip the teether by the legs and to chew on the giraffe s ears or nose   i ve seen other babies who prefer to chew on the front or back legs   one baby i know even prefers to chew on the giraffe s rump   with so many choices  your baby is bound to discover one that she/he likes   additionally  the teether makes a squeaky sound when squeezed  think about a traditional dog squeaky toy    my baby likes this sound  as do my dogs    finally  the all rubber surface of this teether makes it easy to clean   these are the benefits here are the downsides   the rubber on this teether is a bit stinky and definitely has a taste that my baby isn t thrilled about   she s willing to put up with it  but i can tell that the taste isn t as pleasant to her as that of some of her other teethers   also  this teether doesn t have any rough patches or bumps  and those bumps are soothing to babies with serious teething going on   finally  this teether costs double or triple what other teethers cost  and that s a big downside if you re buying this for your own baby   so  weigh the pros against the cons and make a decision if this teether is right for you '\n",
      " u'i always give this gift as a present whenever someone has a baby and it always goes over well   my daughter introduced me to it when she had her baby   it is a lovely baby gift !'\n",
      " u'amazon is great!  bought for the giraffe and not necessarily to be used as a teether   product was excellent quality but the price might have been a little high?i could see where this would be great for babies who are teething'\n",
      " u'this is the greatest teething aid i ve ever seen   our baby loves it  and it s 100 percent natural   the giraffe design catches our little one s eyes  she enjoys the squeaks  and she won t let go of it   in fact  it s safe to say it s become one of her favorite toys   if you re looking for a great teether  you can t go wrong with sophie the giraffe '\n",
      " u'this is the second sophie i ve bought for a grandchild   there is no beating this most loved friend   the boys love teething on her and she is easy for them to hold   when i was first introduced to sophie my first thought was \"are you kidding me    it looks like a toy i would have had as a baby \"  boy  was i wrong!  sophie rules!'\n",
      " u'my 6 month old got sophie when she was a little over two months old and  quite frankly  wasn t at all interested in her  but by 5 months when the drooling started in earnest and everything went to her mouth  she realized sophie is wonderful! she loves the squeak toy aspect though it does confuse our poor dog since it sounds like a dog toy  but the squeaky kisses sophie gives my girl brings laughter and smiles every time  well worth the price but certainly order this from amazon as it costs $5 6 more at babies  r us!'\n",
      " u'soft and has a squeak     4 month old just figured out how to make it squeak on purpose  love it! thanks'\n",
      " u'i bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it  it has a soft texture to it and is easy for her to hold she also likes it to squeak  she looks for it when you squeak it '\n",
      " u'my baby loved this product  so easy for little hands to hold  glad i bought this for her  definitely recommend'\n",
      " u'sophie the girafe is the best toy ever invented!:   my daughter loves to chew on her even today at fifteen months old   we could note have gotten thru teething without sophie   everyone who sees sophie always yells \"sophie we love her!\":   it is also nice knowing that she is not made in china   one of the only teethers out there unless you go to a super specialty store   out only problem is that our lab still thinks it belonds to him and he tries to \"steal\" sophie on occassion!: '\n",
      " u'we gave sophie to our kid when he was 4 months and he still loves it  loves to chew on the giraffe in all possible ways  probably not his favorite but he nibbles on it quite often whenever he feels like biting on something '\n",
      " u'i ve bought 4  no really  anyone that even looks pregnant is getting one from now on  just a wise purchase all the parents rave and the kids seems fixated on sophie  wish they had more products alongside it '\n",
      " u'the title says it all    this teething toy is the only toy that works for molars  and anyone who s had a child knows the molars are the worst!   the legs are just long enough to be chewed on without worrying about baby gagging on them '\n",
      " u'loved the product  is used on a daily basis by the beautiful recipient   sad to say that when it was received the box was destroyed  embarassing when giving it as a gift!'\n",
      " u'i gifted this to a mom to be so her second child would have her own sophie just like her first child   mom was very happy sophie is a great gift for new babies '\n",
      " u'my 8 month old son just received sophie and absolutely loves her! so does my husband and the dog too! more than just a teether  my son loves to shake sophie around just to hear her squeak! i let him take sophie to his crib for nap time but had to take her away as he was just having way too much fun playing with her  get one!'\n",
      " u'this is an awesome teether  slightly expensive but my son used it for months so it was definitely worth it  he loved it! very cool teether '\n",
      " u'my aunt bought us this for our first girl  and both she and our now 1 year old loved it   they can chew on the legs  bend them and the neck   and since it is durable but all natural we had no fear of choking or other issues   this is also very easy to wash off in the sink since it gets chewed on a lot '\n",
      " u'this was recommended to me by a friend  i bought it when my daughter was 3 months old and she loves it! she chews on it wherever we go and it is always with us! she smiles when we squeak it and she can manipulate it very well! we are actually buying a 2nd one to have as a backup in case we lose the first  we highly recommend this to all parents '\n",
      " u'how else can you spend approximately $20 to watch your child gnaw on a silly gummy toy and thoroughly consider it money well spent? i thought it was absolutely ridiculous to spend this much on a kid s chew toy  but after my child found it completely addictive while teething  i bought another one  the only drawback to this toy is that if you wash it too many times  the spots come off and sophie ends up looking like a freaky albino   '\n",
      " u'this toy is very cute to look at and very easy to handle for a baby   the baby s mother specifically asked for this  so i purchased 2   one for a baby born and another baby due in march '\n",
      " u'my six month old daughter loves her sophie yes  it looks and sounds like a dog toy  but it is also made of safe materials and i am sure dog toys are not given the same care   my daughter does occasionally get a giraffe leg pretty far into her mouth and it makes her gag  but she s not really choking   sophie s body gets in the way and it s not like she could swallow it we actually like how much interest the dog is showing in the toy  thanks to the squeak  because it s given us a great opportunity to make sure the dog understands that whatever the baby has  no matter how exciting it may look/smell/sound  is absolutely not hers   it s worked really well sophie is perfect for teething because it has just enough flexibility  it is easy for my daughter to hold  and it is clear it makes her teeth feel better   i say register for it for a shower or birthday and hope someone buys it for you  so then you don t have to worry about whether or not it is overpriced '\n",
      " u'my daughter chewed on it a little  but actually ended up preferring metal teething rings  she liked playing with it more than nibbling on it '\n",
      " u'my 6 month old loved it and reached for sophie the moment she saw it and promptly started chewing on it so vulli  must have gotten something right about the teether  her 3 year old twin cousins were playing n squeaking it as well   so all in all a good purchase   both for teething n play '\n",
      " u'my 4 5 months little daughter love this teether very much and like to bytes it a lot at her age now '\n",
      " u'cute teether  easy to clean  seems like every mom has one now! my son likes it  doesn t have to have it '\n",
      " u'we just got our adorable sophie this week and my 4 & 1/2 month old daughter loves it  i m sure there are other great teethers out there but sophie is easy for chubby hands to grab and she has lots of long or nubby bits to chew on   whatever baby is in the mood for   our daughter smiles every time she sees her sophie and is content to gnaw on her when she needs to   i love that sophie is made from rubber trees and non toxic food grade paint  love her!'\n",
      " u'it was absolutely amazing  we didn t even put the sophie teether on our registry and we got 4 of them from friends  there s a reason why  kids love this thing  our 6 month old loves chewing on this thing whether it s on the couch  in the car or in his crib! the squeaky sound is an added bonus because it gives his feedback when he presses on the toy!'\n",
      " u'my 6 month old s favorite toy by far  i love that she is non toxic  no bpa or other bad chemicals  she has so many places to chew and she is the perfect size for my little one s hands  a must have!'\n",
      " u'my 4 months old has been chewing happily on sophie for a month now  we take her everywhere  soft  easy to hold and my son loves to chew suck hold this giraffe  well worth the price!!'\n",
      " u'my 5 mos old son took to this immediately  the shape of the neck makes it easy to hold and the shape of the legs allows him to stick the feet toward the backs of his gums for sucking and chewing  easing discomfort from teething   only the melissa and doug bugs container seems to offer similar toys that reach back there with ease  few toys have that extension and texture   especially in his car seat  he often falls asleep with the tip of a leg in his mouth i was surprised that the toy is so soft and hollow; i d expected a foam and not the \"dog toy\" texture   and sure enough  my dog loves this giraffe!  we stepped out of the room to change a diaper and the dog  who normally shadows us  was nowhere to be seen   suddenly \"squeak squeak squeak\" could be heard from across the house   our darling mutt schemed to wait til we left to grab the giraffe and race off with his prize   lol    every chance he gets!  i suppose that s a downside  but we just clean it with soap and hot water or stick it in the dishwasher and we re good to go   anyway  we can legitimately say that the whole family loves this toy!'\n",
      " u'i received this as a gift for my second child  it is the best teether toy  she would suck and teeth on it for hours  i was so impressed with the product that i purchased a couple of other vulli teethers in other styles  those however  did not have the same impact as sophie the giraffe and were ignored  hands down  sophie is it '\n",
      " u'sophie is great  i had my doubts about spending this much money for a &#34;chew toy&#34; but it was well worth it  we ve had it for almost 2 years now and it still looks great and my 2 year old son still plays with it '\n",
      " u'my niece is 9 months old and loves her giraffe  it is great because it easy for her to grasp and the long neck allows her to keep her hands naturally in front of her while chewing it  the colors on the giraffe have not faded  this little toy stands up to major wear and tear  delightful toy for a little one!'\n",
      " u'best toy/teether everwe re in love with sophie  this definitely is a must have for moms and babies everywhere : '\n",
      " u'my son loves this toy  and has from the beginning!  we received it as a gift when he was 2 months old   at that age  he loved looking at the contrast of the spots and feeling the funny shape of the toy   as he got a little older  he loved the squeaker  especially when he discovered that he could do it himself   now that he is teething he mouths it all day   i think the hard rubber and shape of the features offer many different surfaces to soothe his sore gums i like that fact that it is not made of cheap plastic   i feel more confident that this toy is safe for my son i would definitely recommend sophie!'\n",
      " u'this is my grand daughters favorite toy! it s great to hold and she loves to chew on it  i also ordered her the sophie the giraffe first book  but never received it '\n",
      " u'i didn t really do much research on this product  a close friend  who is also a ft nanny  recommended this product  \"you have have have to get this!!!!!\" i thought it was a pretty expensive teething toy  but i bought it nonetheless because my 8 month old son hasn t been too fond of cold teething rings and similar items i did not know it was also a squeaky toy!!! it s not that bad though it s easy to rinse off  it s easy to find  i just wish it wasn t such a pricey item '\n",
      " u'this is the first review i ve written for anything  but we love sophie so much i wanted to share our delight  my four month old grasped her right out of the package  even with not much hand control  she can hold sophie and chew on her with great satisfaction! the texture seems to bring relief to her sore gums and there are many choices for chewing  legs  nose  ears   even my 6 and 10 year olds love sophie  they make her dance and squeak for their baby sister  this is our third baby  rather then buying a million little toys  we are buying a few  more expensive  but quality toys and teethers  sophie is worth the money '\n",
      " u'he loves this giraffe! he will extend his arm and smack it on the ground back and forth  he likes to put it under his knee and squeak it when he is sitting in his bouncer  this is his buddy when we travel and he will kick it in his car seat '\n",
      " u'this toy is awesome  my 3 1/2 year old can hold it easily and stick sophie in the mouth! can t ask for more than that '\n",
      " u'my daughter really loved sophie at 4 months and during teething time   she also enjoys the other products made by this vendor '\n",
      " u'this is a must have for the modern teething baby loll it s a lot cheaper on amazon i love it baby loves it what eel is ther to say'\n",
      " u'   i just saw other baby s happily mawing it everywhere we went i d come across sophie during my pre baby hunt for usable items and this rated well  but i wasn t 100% convinced then i noticed babies happily gnawing on it many places we went and decided to order one once i had it  a gal in my parenting support group mentioned it was on oprah  etc that didn t matter to me at all because my little guy loves mashing his gums of the giraffe s feet and face i do see the paint slowly wearing away  but it s food grade dye  so i m not worried about it  i don t think my little one cares about the visual appeal of the giraffe  except for the creepy black eyes those eyes are on nearly all his toys and he loves staring at them overall  if your baby loves to chew and maw this is a good teether '\n",
      " u'i am a foster parent and have three babies use this teether   it is a great product   the babies love it '\n",
      " u'i didn t get sophie for my first baby because i couldn t justify spending close to $20 on a teething toy  i broke down and bought it for my second baby and i m so glad i did!  he just loves it!!  he plays with it more than his other pricier toys and it seems to soothe his sore gums  his face lights up when he sees sophie  even my two year old wants to play with her!'\n",
      " u'what a great toy!  my 7 mo old just loves it!  he s teething right now and he just loves to gnaw on sophie   it s nice to have a toy that i know isn t exposing him to all sorts of toxic chemicals when he puts it in his mouth   we also like the fact that you can squeeze any part of sophie and she will squeak  you don t have to squeeze in one specific spot   overall a fantastic toy   i will be giving it as a gift to expectant parents for years to come!'\n",
      " u'i bought this teether for my daughter about a year ago   it has become her favorite teether   she seems to select which leg or ear to chew on based on which tooth is bugging her   my favorite feature is the cleanablility   we all know how frequently toys end up on the floors of restaurants  stores  etc '\n",
      " u'my daughter enjoyed this toy so much  not only for teething help but also for entertainment  the quality is wonderful and i believe we will pass this down to the next one  : '\n",

      " u'my son is 7 months old and sophie goes everywhere with us!  she stays in his carseat when we re home just to make sure that she s in the car with us when we leave   my son laughs and laughs every time she squeaks   i highly recommend her!'\n",
      " u'sophie is a baby s best friend   cute  squeaky and fun to chew and drool on   sophie should definitely be on your \"to  buy\" list   great gift too!'\n",
      " u'my little niece loves this thing  she is still extremely young so she can t quite gnaw on it  but she loves to rub the ears and feet on her gums the squeak it makes it cute too  though you might want to show the baby the noise before hand  it startled my niece a bit '\n",
      " u'my son loves sophie  when he hears her squeak  he gets excited and looks for her  and she s always got a smile on her face! she s easy to clean  however  if she gets a little too wet  she looses her squeak for a few days  i was really bumped to hear the garbled squeak but she luckily came back after a few days  at first i was hesitant to buy buy her due to the price but so happy i did  she is loved in our home! : '\n",
      " u'our girl loves her sophie  we actually lost her first one  and she was always trying to steal her cousin s sophie!we re ordered one for her and now all is right with the world once again it is super cute when she crawls with it because it squeaks '\n",
      " u'i ordered this for my son  he chews on her all day  sophie is easy to clean and my son  never gets tires of her '\n",
      " u'my son at 5 months already has his two bottom teeth and is trying to put everything in his mouth   if he can t reach where he wants to chew he gets sorta fussy but sophie has so many teething options that he will chew on it for quite some time without throwing it down   the legs are perfect for farther back in his mouth and i am not worried about parts coming off  great product!!'\n",
      " u'like every other parent out there that has talked to me about this toy  for whatever reason babies gravitate towards it   my son recently started teething and with the multiple teething aids available this is his go to   no idea why   the squeaking is fun too   it makes him laugh '\n",
      " u'i bought this for my 6 month old based on all the positive reviews  but was dubious as he did not really enjoy any other teething rings we had bought himsophie arrived promptly and was well packaged  with no damage to any packaging or the toy  we just gave the toy a quick wash  for safety s sake  and handed it over  my wee boy loved it and it went straight into his mouth  the shape is ideal for small hands  it is easily manipulated  and there is not a surface that cannot fit into a mouth sophie washes easily so can be kept clean of food and the general mess that babies toys can get into  one quick wash and it is good to go  this has fast become our wee boys favourite toy and is definitely worth the money '\n",
      " u'this is the cheapest i ve seen it anywhere and with the free prime shipping it was even better!  my five month old daughter loves her sophie   other than a freezable gel ring we bought for a couple of bucks  it s the only teething toy we will need to buy '\n",
      " u'one of the best teething toys ever  my daughter has love this and chewed on it for teething since she was about 3 mos old due to the size and shape it s easy for her to hold and control  i know buy them as baby shower gifts because get are so great '\n",
      " u'after all the hype i have heard about how this giraffe is the best teething toy and how much babies love it  i decided to try it for my four month old son   i was wary of spending so much on a baby toy  however  so i used a coupon and a gift card to purchase it   thank goodness i didn t spend $17 on this!  it is kind of cute  but i was immediately disappointed by the flimsy rubber and almost \"dog toy\" quality of the toy   then i squeezed the darn thing and it let out the loudest squeak!  not impressed   my son does kind of like to chew on it  but the squeak scares him!  my husband squeezed it to try to entertain him the other day  and the baby started crying! some kids might enjoy the sound  but i don t think this is going to be one my child s favorite toys update  august 29  2011 :  i take back what i said about sophie   my son is now 9 months old  and he has grown quite fond of sophie   he actually likes the squeak now  and he loves to chew on her   still not sure if she is worth $17  but i am glad i bought her!  i m changing my rating from 2 stars to 4 '\n",
      " u'baby girl loves her new friend and is able to hold on to it with a tight grip   a little more than you would pay for for a regular teether  but quite worth the money!  she loves sophie!'\n",
      " u'being a child photographer  i saw lots of kids with this giraffe and parents would always say \"i don t know why but he/she loves this thing  we have to have it everywhere with us\" so when i had my own baby  i thought i must have this thing  i was so excited to open it and give it to my almost 4 month old son  and then    i realized  i love sophie much more than he does right now! she is very lightweight and easy for him to hold but with his hand/eye coordination not being so great yet  he can t get it into his mouth as easily as he d like  leading to lots of eye pokes  i ve determined that this is something he can only have while highly supervised for now! i expect his love for sophie will grow as he does though '\n",
      " u'this was the best thing to have when my daughter was teething   when we received it as a gift  i had never heard of it   the paint comes off as the child chews on it  but it is edible safe paint   it is very durable and perfect for children s little hands   we passed our daughter s on to a cousin after she was finished with it and it is still going strong!  now i just purchased this as a gift for a new mom   highly recommend!!'\n",
      " u'sophie is very cute and well made  good quality   i was very excited when i got it and couldn t wait to give it to my baby boy  who is 8 months old   supprisely he is not interested in it at all   he kep pushing it away '\n",
      " u'i heard about sophie in a stroller strides class when my son was two months old   i immediately purchased her and it was by far my son s favorite teether   ten months later sophie is still fully intact and my son s favorite teether   to keep her squeeker working  you have to remember not to get water in it when washing her! we have been successful thus far!'\n",
      " u'i have no idea what the fascination is with the sophie but since it works like a charm  i ll take it  it seems to be the ideal size to grip and helps so much during the teething phase  definitely worth the money '\n",

      " u'we got this toy when our baby was 3 5 months old  all the little ones in our brooklyn neighborhood have this thing  so i figured there was good reason for it   indeed   it s dimensions make it easy to grasp  my baby s little fingers fit nicely around the head  neck  or any of the legs  the long neck of the giraffe make it so that when she s holding it at her waist with her hands  it reaches all the way up to her mouth   she loves chewing on all the knobs around the head and on the hooves   she is attracted to the simple face with it s dark eye dots and loves to make it squeak   this is a fantastic toy  no wonder it s been around for so many decades!'\n",
      " u'i love this teether! it s pricey but worth it  my four month old loves it and gets excited when he sees it  it s the perfect size for his little hands  sophie will definitely be my go to baby shower gift from now on!'\n",
      " u'i have bought sophie for both my kids as well as friends and family too  my kdis loved sophie  it is the perfect size for baby to hold and they would spend forever slobbering all over sophie when they were teething  they never took to other teething toys  i thought the price was crazy when i first saw it for a teether but after all the reviews had to give it a shot and was well worth the money!!'\n",
      " u'my son loves sophie   he smiles as soon as he hears it squeaking   he was able to hold it and chew on it beginning at four months  and sophie has been wonderful for teething '\n",

      " u'our 6 week old loves sophie! i started letting her chew on sophie very early so she d be used to the taste  smell  etc  before she started teething  she loves to chew on her face! she knows the sound of the squeak now and will look for it when she hears it '\n",
      " u'i tried to offer this to my son several times when he was a few months old and he was very disinterested  eventually when he was about 5 months old he suddenly became interested  he likes it but it s not his favorite by any means  these teething rings from vulli win hands down over sophie http://www amazon com/vulli vanilla flavored teethe colors/dp/b001n45dm2/ref=sr_1_2?s=baby products&ie=utf8&qid=1360729347&sr=1 2&keywords=vulli and they are adorable'\n",
      " u'well  she s kind of in love with sophie a little   she gets annoyed when she can t quite get sophie into her mouth the way she wants the dogs   really  really want sophie in a bad  bad way so i m almost certain that eventually  they ll end up eating this seventeen dollar teething toy   : '\n",
      " u'my lo loves this toy  it helps with teething and is entertaining  the only down side to the product is trying to clean between the horns and and ears  you have to really get in there because gunk accumulates '\n",
      " u'i swore i would never buy this teether  as i thought it was just over priced and over hyped   but  when our daughter reached the age where she wanted to put anything and everything in her mouth  i caved and thought we d give it a whirl because those legs & ears looked like they were the perfect size for her continuous gumming turns out  i was correct: this giraffe is basically just a glorified squeak toy; even has that dog toy smell! with that said  my daughter still likes it   she s not even teething age yet  she just likes gumming it  so we re pretty sure she ll just love it even more once she s teething   if she continues at the rate she s going  we ll probably get our money s worth with this teether   in the end  i m pretty sure it s a good investment!'\n",
      " u'we bought this teether for our 4th month old son   we had searched high and low for a bpa free teether that was small enough for our young teether   well  sophie the giraffe was the answer   our son loves sophie   and with her 100% all natural including the food paint she is colored with we have nothing to worry about   the cost is worth it  she is the only teether your child will ever need!!'\n",
      " u'i debated over buying this product for a long time  my friend had one for her son and i read so many reviews and couldn t believe what people were saying about sophie and i was having a hard time justifying spending $20 on something my son may not like  well after a terrible few days of teething i broke down and bought sophie  my husband thought i was crazy  well let me tell you my son loves her  he is amazed by her and he plays and chews on her all the time  every review is right  it is worth the money and your child will love her '\n",
      " u'my daughter had a sophie in the mid 70 s   though it was a bit smaller   it didn t survive over all these years so i was delighted to find one on amazon   it is still a huge success both for it s teething qualities but also as an entertainment with its squeaky \"voice\"   i am ordering another one for my great great grandniece today '\n",
      " u'it s a good one my baby likes it very much it s so good!it makes my baby not crying i will buy it soon'\n",
      " u'i was skeptical when my wife said that she had ordered a [   ] toy for our son  but he has had his sophie for a couple of months now  and absolutely loves it   one of the best things about it is the skinny neck and legs   that makes it much easier for little hands to grab and hold on to   it is great to put in his carseat because it is one of the toys that he doesn t easily drop  which makes car rides that much more fun   the heavy rubber is a nice change of pace from the soft stuffed toys and the hard plastic toys too   i highly recommend it '\n",
      " u'this is a great teether and toy! every time our daughter sees it she smiles and reaches for it  it can be washed in the dishwasher to keep it sanitized  i can only say get it!! it will be a great item for your child '\n",
      " u'my grandson dragged this around until he started to walk   since then  he keeps it under his arm wherevr he goes '\n",
      " u'i bought this for my grandson on a recommendation by a young mother and my grandson loves it   it s soft and squeaks easily and is easy to hold onto '\n",
      " u'my baby boy is 5 months old and seems to really like sophie   she is chewable almost everywhere and he will switch it up  she helps his gums feel better   i recommend this toy '\n",
      " u'i actually purchased sophie elsewhere but i was skeptical when i saw it and the price tag attached to it  i thought it was an over priced toy that parents were being suckered into buying  but i ended up buying it anyways and i m glad i did  my 8 month old daughter loves sophie so much! she loves the texture of the rubber and it squeaks with minimal pressure to any part of the giraffe  i would buy this again in a heartbeat '\n",
      " u'never thought i d see my son french kissing a giraffe  let alone french kissing a french giraffe  but he adores her so  i swear sophie is like crack for 4 month olds  he looks at her and gets this possessed look in his eyes  reaches out  grabs her with his little chubby hands around her legs  and stuffs her nose into his mouth  where he proceeds with a veritable orgy of chewing  the natural rubber is a little squeaky on his gums when he bites  and when he squeezes her body  she squeaks  which delights him  we ve gotten more giggles by dancing sophie s feet on his tummy while squeaking her  he s teething furiously right now  and sophie makes it a little more fun  the one we got had no issues with running paint or fragile rubber  it is tough  durable  and he s slobbered all over the thing without paint coming off  so i think we re good  but remember that a lot of these come from different sellers  even if amazon is shipping them prime sophie s been around for 50 years for a reason   eta: after a couple months of use  some of the paint is starting to wear off sophie s ears  and there are a few tiny cracks in the surface of the paint  but with the abuse she gets from my kids  this seems well within the acceptable range for me  my special needs 7 year old tends to swipe her whenever she can  and uses her to bounce against her ipad she uses for communication  which is good  because it doesn t trigger the ipad s screen and is not likely to hurt it  the baby loves to gnaw on every part of the giraffe  and popped 2 teeth before 5 months old '\n",
      " u'my girl loves this toy  she chews on it a lot  making a funny squeeky sound with her yet teethless gums  i like that the toy is very light and bends easily  and made of natural materials  it s the first toy my baby was able to sqeeze and bend to make a sound '\n",
      " u'my husband gave me a strange look when i announced that i bought an almost $20 squeak toy  but after having this for six  6  months he now understands that it was worth it!the product description of this toy seems a little whimsical when it describes how it is a toy for all the senses; however  i am 100% sold   besides the smell  it doesn t really seem to have a scent   i would argue that this one toy does entice my baby s sense of sight  touch  taste  and hearing summary of the pros:  color  i like that this toy is not obnoxiously bright blue  pink  green  yellow and orange!  every other toy is an eyesore   the squeak is slightly annoying  like any squeak toy  but it really does make my baby smile when we are out and he gets fussy  the rubber is soft enough that my baby can chew on it without injuring himself and not too soft to puncture  the chewing sound does make a rubbing rubber sound that makes me cringe  but baby loves it    the &#34;small&#34; parts  i like that the legs  neck and head are small enough for my baby to grab and chew on without being too small cons:  slightly expensive  but worth it in my opinion   another mom friend said that the squeak sounds similar to that of her dog s toys so the dog likes to play with this too   having two  2  dogs that love squeak toys i am amazed that my dogs have not touched this toy   i wish there were real instructions  not just vague information on the box  concerning cleaning   if the squeaker gets wet it sounds like sophie has a serious cold for a few days until it dries   along with this i am also potentially concerned about mold or anything growing inside   no worries yet but i can see how this may occur it may sound strange that all of my pros seemed to have cons attached  but i would like to be clear   i would buy this product again and i would highly recommend this product to anyone with an infant '\n",
      " u'i sometimes think that there is an addictive substance hidden within our sophie  man  my toddler loves nothing more then this little creation  i initially scoffed at the price of this item and held out on buying it  until i saw my little guy try to steal it from a friend  the next day he got his own sophie  and i became a believer  the price of this toy far outweighed the possible embarassment of him getting caught red handed again :  worth every penny!'\n",
      " u'great gift for expectant mother or baby teeting  very cute and tried and true  i recommend sophie the giraffe teether '\n",
      " u'my daughter was given this as a gift  and being my first child  i had never heard of \"sophie\" before   i was impressed with the story that comes along with it  with respect to the natural rubber and safe paint  but was really surprised with how much my little girl absolutely loves it!!  as soon as she started gripping objects  this one became her favorite as it is easy to hang onto   she is just starting to teethe  and chews on either the legs or head constantly   i would absolutely recommend this as a gift for your child or for any baby shower gift   thanks tammy!! : '\n",
      " u'best teether ever! it s my daughter s favorite and easy for her little hands to grasp and hold with its skinny neck and legs  she grabs it and goes to town! : '\n",
      " u'i got this for my daughter when she was 3 months old  she took to it immediately  it s really easy to grip for her since both the neck and the legs are skinny enough for her little hands  it s easy to clean and actually really cute  my daughter is now 7 months and has got her first two teeth  and she still absolutely loves chewing on sophie  highly recommend this toy!'\n",
      " u'i purchased this for my at the time 6 month old for christmas  i had seen it previously and i didn t really \"get it\"  it looked like an over priced dog toy to me  the reviews are consistently excellent though so i decided to try it anyway  i m do glad we ordered it  my little guy favors it the most out of all of his teethers and insists that it goes everywhere with us  i m thinking about buying a second one for just in case! definetly worth adding to your little teethers collection!'\n",
      " u'sophie is so cute  and comes just as seen! i can t wait to see how my son reacts to her when he is born  she is very popular  and would buy for a gift any day!'\n",
      " u'don t really think this needs a review because everyone has heard all about sophie  but it is a great product  made well and this kids  and dogs  love her! great for boys and girls and makes a perfect baby shower gift for all your friends!'\n",
      " u'so much more than a teether  it helps my daughter learn to grab and develop hand to mouth coordination; and the squeak factor is a great distractor if she s feeling a little cranky  as a teether  the giraffe is perfect  she can get at it from all different angles  and just chew away  the best part is that i don t worry about what she s chewing on  since the giraffe has no harmful \"ingredients\"  if i could give the giraffe ten stars  i would thank you to my sister in law for this amazing gift  and thank you to vulli for making it!'\n",
      " u'i tried to fight the urge to buy it and not get sucked into the pressure of everyone else buying a $20 rubber toy   but my baby was teething so badly i was desperate   i don t know what this thing is made of but it works   he will chomp on this for a long time '\n",
      " u'at first i was very hesitant to buy this teether  i was thinking the cost was pretty high for just a teether and i was worried it would be too big  however  when i opened the package i knew it would be perfect  she is very soft and is a great material for babies  my son is three months old and teething so i had to get something for him to be able to hold himself  sophie is great  she is easy for him to hold and he loves to chew on her legs and ears  he also loves to hold on to her and he enjoys that she squeaks he giggles   i think the item is a very good product for any age and i highly recommend it  the only thing i would be careful of is water getting in it  i hold my finger over the hole so the squeaker wont get ruined great product!'\n",
      " u'my son has had his sophie since he was 4 months old and he absolutely loves it! all of the reviews about the choking hazard are silly because your child should never be left alone with any toy    this is one of my son s favorite toys and everything about it is wonderful  its very easy to clean and we take it with us everywhere we go '\n",
      " u'when my daughter first asked for this giraffe for her baby girl  i thought she was out of her mind   now i m a huge fan!  sophie is made in france  not scary china   and so she can teethe to her heart s content   plus sophie is cute and different   but not unique:  everyone seems to have one!  my granddaughter loves to play with her  and sophie s an especially good distraction in the stroller and carseat vulli sophie the giraffe teether  brown/ white'\n",

      " u'age recommendation for this is 0 and up  but we didn t buy one for our little one until she was 7 months we gave it to her and her eyes lit up! she held it  and instantly started teething with it  eventually she got it to squeak and it made her smile sophie the giraffe is really adorable   we it with us while out and several people commented on how cute the giraffe is be forewarned though  if you have dogs  they take a big interest in this! the squeaker sounds very similar to dog toys '\n",
      " u'i bought this for my new grandson  he isn t quite old enough to hold it  much less chomp on it  i know he will love it '\n",
      " u'i love this little giraffe teether and plan to give it as a baby gift with the two accompanying books   unfortunately the shipping  package was not approriate   soft  and the item box got damaged   not too happy about that  since this is for a gift '\n",

      " u'this toy has grown on me as my daughter has now had it for about 6 months  it is great for when they are tiny  my 10 week old baby could hold this light toy on her own and make it squeak  she now gnaws on it to sooth her gums  i think it s a soothing toy to play with for kids who are not binky or thumb suckers  i love when i hear her squeaking it  it s almost her way of saying  \"hello  i m here \" very cute  i have since given several sophie s as baby shower gifts one thing to note  this is not a hard plastic toy  it is soft and squishy and squeaks like a dog toy '\n",
      " u'my daughter began teething at 3 months and did not have her first tooth pop until 7 months   it was definately uncomfortable and painful for her   we tried numerous teething toys but this was by far her favorite!  she loves to chew on the legs which relieves her pain   she still plays with it today  even though she s past her teething '\n",

      " u'my son has been enjoying sophie for about 3 months now   he is currently 6 months old and this is by far one of his favorite toys   this toy is very easy for him to grab with those little fingers and he loves chewing on legs  ear  horns and mouth   he also loves the squeak  i can always get a smile out of him by bringing sophie to his attention   sophie is also very easy to clean if dropped  which  lets face it  happens quite often at this age!'\n",
      " u'i also wondered why i would spend [   ] for what some people were calling a \"dog toy\"   i m glad i did though   he really does love munching on the legs  ears & face of sophie more then any other teething toy he has   sophie is soft & fits easily in his mouth & easy to grip   and it s easy to clean!'\n",
      " u'my four month old loves sophie! as the description mentions  it captures the attention of her senses  including hearing and smell  she also loves looking at sophie s spots  the toy cleans easily and she almost likes it *too* much    she gets upset when she can t get the little hooves in her mouth fast enough!'\n",

      " u'i looked at this teether forever before i finally broke down and paid $19  for it  it says that the paint does not come off and it does  my son is only 3 months old and is teething but has no teeth through yet but is still able to suck the paint off of it and i wiped it down with a wipe and the paint on her eyes also comes off  i cannot understand why ppl have said that the spots are actually a part of her rubber body because they are painted on and they do come off and im very unhappy about this because i read all the good reviews about it and finallt decided to order it and im very disappointed '\n",

      " u'when i first got sophie in the mail  i had some buyers remorse because it did seem like a glorified dog toy   as soon as i gave to to my 5 month old son he loved it!  it is by far the toy he plays with the most!  he is teething but i think he would like it anyway because it is so easy to grab and squeak!  my husband thinks that sophie is too girly of a name for a boy toy so he insists that we call him jerry   it is really funny   this toy is on the expensive side but i have to say that it is really worth it!'\n",

      " u'at first i was skeptical  i mean $17 for a chew toy that looks more like a dog toy? but  after reading the reviews and going nuts with a teething baby i gave it a shot and bought one  as soon as our daughter saw it she smiled  and as you know that s worth a million bucks  and although she wasn t very good with her hands yet  she tried to get it in her mouth  after an incident where our puppy grabbed sophie and ran around the yard with her we figured we better get a back up or two  sophie is our go to girl whenever baby is crying  bored  cranky  sleepy  you get the picture  she seems to make everything better  and anyone with a small baby knows  that alone is worth the $17 '\n",
      " u'i got sophie for my baby when she was 3 months old  she is 7 already and still loves it  and others kids who see the giraffe also get crazy for it!'\n",
      " u'my little girl is 3 months and teething already so i needed a teether that she could easily hold  i received sophie today and i think it s a cute toy  it does look a lot like a cheap dog toy but that fact it is made of natural rubber and food grade paint was a plus with me  my daughter can hold it but she wasn t really interested in putting it in her mouth  she still goes for her hands  she did however enjoy me playing with her with the toy  she smiled several times at the giraffe during playtime  i am just going to keep reintroducing the toy in hopes she will use it as teether instead of her hands  i m not sure this would be a good toy for a baby that already has teeth though because of how soft the rubber is '\n",
      " u'i had put sophie on my registry  but no one purchased it  i m guessing the high cost   i knew that i wanted it after reading the reviews  so i purchased it before my baby was even born  my husband thought i was crazy for spending 20 dollars on a little giraffe toy  but he later realized that it was twenty dollars well spent  when i saw my son starting to put objects into his mouth  i knew it was time for the sophie  this toy has become his favorite toy  no matter where i go  i make sure i have sophie  it will keep him distracted and entertained for a good time  so in conclusion  bite the bullet and buy sophie  you ll be very glad that you did '\n",

      " u'our little guy is teething early and sophie is easy for him to \"hug\" and chew  since he is only 3 months and still working on the fine motor skills   she is big enough that he can wrap his arm around her and chew away   he loves the contrast between the skin and the spots and smiles when we pull her out cute squeek too!  he has already learned to hug her tight to get a little squeek just not sure how to clean her  using soap and warm water  but the directions were a bit ambiguous on the proper technique '\n",

      " u'i got this because my daughter always plays with our friends and she loves it  she does not use it as a teether  but we just had our second child and i am sure he will!! love sophie!!'\n",
      " u'she travels everywhere with us  great toy to tuck under their arm  spark their attention and to chew on  we are constantly referring to her as our son s \"girlfriend \"'\n",
      " u'sophie the giraffe teether   i have given this to several friends with babies  and they have all loved this   also  you can purchase books about sophie  which i think is excellent '\n",
      " u'what can be said that hasn t been said before?  there is a reason why this toy is so popular   there are many shapes for the baby to chew on  satisfying wherever he/she want to reach with it   the legs are particularly nice to reach the molars '\n",

      " u'purchased this for both of my boys and they loved it  it does the job when the kids are teething '\n",
      " u'i gave this as a gift to a 6mos old and he loved it   easy for the child to grip and chew   has a retro squeak too   read the pamphlet it has and interesting history '\n",
      " u'this teether is reserved for future use  it looks cute in the image of giraffe  yet it has a little bit of plastic smell'\n",
      " u'not only did the baby love it  her older siblings kept trying to get it away from her  but she wouldn t budge  she definately made the toy hers   she was thrilled when she realized if she bites down on it  it makes noises   it is soo cute  and the knowledge that they are top grade materials is an added plus  very happy with my purchase '\n",
      " u'i don t know what it is about this thing  but my baby loves it!  she has been playing with sophie everyday since she was about 8 weeks old and she is now almost 8 months   i really do not see the appeal  but every baby seems to love this toy '\n",

      " u'i finally gave in  because i thought it was so cute  and purchased one of these for my daughter   none of her other teething toys would fit in her mouth  plus  most of them were hard for her to grip onto  sophie is perfect  she has so many places to hold and so many small surfaces to chew on  my 2 5 year old also got a major kick out of making the toy squeak  this toy has lasted well after months of use from both a baby and toddler  this is on my list of baby gifts '\n",
      " u'this is an absolute must for a teething baby  dogs love it too! ;  we bought sophie for my now 3 year old and he still plays with her  the paint fades i ve time but it s not a big deal  as with any toy  babies should be supervised while playing/chewing it is not advised that you put this in the microwave or a sterilizer to clean  just wipe with soapy water  do not submerge  or use a disinfecting wipe the shape of sophie is one of the best things about this toy  smaller babies  with less control  have an easier time holding onto it  my children start teething at 3 months or earlier so that is very important to me '\n",
      " u'i heard the hype about sophie and didn t believe it!  but as my baby began to teeth  i figured sophie was so inexpensive that i should give it a try! sophie is the best money i have ever spent in the world of baby products!  at first i was concerned about the length of the legs  but my little guy loves rubbing them on his gums   sophie is his new best friend and a life saver for me!vulli sophie the giraffe teether  brown/ white'\n",
      " u'i purchased for my granddaughter who is 5 months old and teething  honestly  i would have never paid this much for a teething toy for my children  but this has turned out to be her favorite toy   it is soft and chewable and easy for her to grab and hold on to from many angles   it was worth every penney '\n",
      " u'my wife and i purchased this on line without ever seeing it   i of course thought she was nuts but she said we had to have it   so i purchased it and prepared to make fun of her for wasteful spending   we opened the box and i laughed for an hour as it looks like a cheap dog toy now my wife is laughing because it is my babies favorite toy   she chews it  hits me with it  squeeks it and loves it so much she even crawls to it   she just started crawling and will only go after the laptop or the giraffe by the way it goes everywhere with us   i guess i should have not purchased all the other toys and just got her this   other toys she is tired of in a day   this darn giraffe she has been playing with for over a month '\n",
      " u'a great stylish teather toy  easy to clean and all teaching babies will love its easy for even quite small babies to hold '\n",
      " u'my grand daughter loved this toy giraffe  thought it was a little too pricey  but she loved it so much!'\n",
      " u'every baby needs a sophie giraffe   this is a very hot baby toy for a good reason   fun  safe  chewy  and squeaky!'\n",
      " u'i read tons of reviews on sofie the giraffe and thought it was too good to be true  actually  it is better  my 5 month old teething son adores her  i don t know how we got by without her  thank you vulli for making a safe and fun product made in germany not china '\n",
      " u'ds loves his sophie and is very vocal while gnawing on her   the material is good but like others have said it s very comparable to a dog toy   and it s even been mistaken for one!!  the legs are too long in my opinion and ds has gagged on them when he sticks sophie in his mouth too far   i really dislike the smell of the rubber but i guess that comes with a rubber toy   overall i m glad mil gave us this as a gift but no way would i have spent almost $20 on it   just sayin '\n",
      " u'i doubt i can add anything that hasn t already been said about sophie!  she is a must have for all babies!  this was one of the first toys we gave to our daughter and she has loved it ever since!  we thought we lost sophie and my husband ordered another one right away!  well worth the money!'\n",
      " u'this was recommended by a friend and i have gifted it a few times now at baby showers   received a picture text of my nephew this weekend gnawing away on his   lots of drool and two fists smashing sophie into his so far toothless grin   one warning   the last sophie i ordered came in a crushed box  since i did not have time to return it for a new one prior to the shower i attached her to the outside of the gift with ribbon like an embelishment   that is how we discovered that sophie squeaks   and wow did the dog come running   if you have dogs you may have a hard time convincing them that sophie is for the human baby   other than that she seems to be a big hit with all of the recipients '\n",
      " u'my 4 month old loves it! it s easy for him to hold and has different bits to gnaw on  i recommend sophie '\n",
      " u'my baby loves this teether  she likes to wave it around and play with it  she loves chewing on it and the squeaking noise it makes causes her to laugh out loud  love this little toy  i will  be purchasing two more for each of my new nieces '\n",
      " u'we bought this when my son was 3 months old and he has been chewing on sofie for the past 4 months   he loves it!  i love it!  it soothes his need to chew '\n",
      " u'we love sophie at our house    she is a great teether and a great toy for entertainment   our 18 month old still loves her   she is the perfect size for gripping and holding and biting    she is natural which is great too    and she is so cute!'\n",
      " u'how can you not love the sophie teether?it s absolutely adorable and all the kids love this toy will buy more '\n",
      " u'right out of the box and into my little ones mouth  it s a great size for my 5 month old to hold and put into his mouth  he loves the nose  ears and feet  worth the money '\n",
      " u'my daughter just loves sophie the giraffe  we have had her for over a month and she still makes my daughter smile  i waited awhile to order her because of the price  if you are waiting please don t you will love her and so will you teething baby'\n",
      " u'my daughter started using this teether at 4 months   she is now six months and it has become her favorite toy/teether   when she was smaller  she would chew on the little ears and face  and now she s able to chew on the legs and feet   i ve tried other teethers to mix it up  but this is the one that she always goes for '\n",
      " u'my son loves his weedee as he calls it do much i got one as a gift for a friend  quality toy worth every penny!'\n",
      " u'when i first recevied the gift i thought it was super cute but was not sure if my baby would chew it  i gave it to her as soon as he noticed her starting to chew on her toys and she hated it  i am sure it is the initial latex taste  but after the second attempt she was hooked  now vulli goes with us as her \"car\" toy  we pack her in her the carseat and she now looks around for her friend  she has been chewing on him for months and it is still in great condition  i would highly recommend vulli   he is cute  easy to clean and babies seem to love him!'\n",
      " u'we received sophie as a gift from grandma  and i m really pleased we did as i d never have thought of it myself! sophie is rapidly becoming one of my four month old daughter s favourite toys: as well as enjoying gnawing on the ears and legs  she has recently become aware of the squeaker and loves it  big smiles and giggles ensue  when i squeak the toy for her    she is now trying to squeak it herself  highly recommended '\n",
      " u'this is a great toy and teether and is the only teether my 5 month old likes   he is able to grab it easily due to sophie s slim neck and the legs fit perfectly into his mouth to chew the price is a bit high  safe for baby and totally worth it '\n",
      " u'my daughter loves her sophie!!!! at first i was hesitate due to the higher than average price point however it has been a lifesaver with a teething baby  i think she really enjoys the shape since it resembles a nipple of a bottle or breast more than most teethers  i have been giving these as baby gifts ever since i bought my daughter one: '\n",
      " u'we bought this toy for my 4 month old daughter   i was reluctant to spend $20 on one teether  but decided to anyway   she loved it   we managed to lose it at the park one day  and so we are buying her a new one because it is such a great teether   it is definitely worth the money   since the spots are made from a natural food coloring  they do come off after time  but not a big deal at all '\n",
      " u'if you re going to a baby shower  definately buy this  i always tie one on top as part of the bow  one of the besties for babies and toddlers  my great grandson still loves his at two years '\n",
      " u'after reading about this baby teether  i wanted one for my expectant daughter   it is precious!  it is safe for a baby  attractive and i can hardly wait to give it to my daughter at her first baby shower   it also didn t hurt that my dog s name is sophie!'\n",
      " u'this teether is super cute! it s soft  it squeaks and my four month old loves it!! wouldl recommend this to a friend '\n",
      " u'our daughter loves this teether  it goes everywhere with us! it is very easy to wipe clean and she loves the squeaky noise! although our dog sometimes thinks its her toy  lol it is a great item  in fact we have bought it as shower gifts because our daughter loves it so much '\n",
      " u'this is my daughter s favorite teether by far!  so much so that we purchased a second one just for purposes of travel  so we always have one at home   the multiple angles allow for her chew on various areas depending on where she s having discomfort '\n",
      " u'we bought sophie for our  then  4 month old daughter  she absolutely loves it! we love sophie too because it is safe  non toxic  and so easy to clean! my baby will hold sophie and \"talk\" to her for hours  she doesn t interact with any other toy like this one  when it s nap time she must have sophie to hold onto  we will probably be buying a second sophie in case something tragic happens to the one we have!'\n",
      " u'i received this toy within the estimated time of arrival  it did not make the squeaky noise  i emailed the seller directly  they shipped out a new one quickly with no questions asked! i would definitely recommend this item  for my 6 month old  as well as this company '\n",
      " u'this is a great toy!! the material is really great  is very easy to squeeze and teething friendly  it seems to be great to bite on  and it also is really pretty !!'\n",
      " u'this is the best best best toy/teether!  my son loves it and he is always chewing on it   i have bought this as gifts and recommend anyone with a baby to get one   everywhere we go  people say  oh  we have that giraffe too and our kids/grandkids  love it   other babies will try and take this  even if they have their own  or they ll ask for one   must have!'\n",
      " u'my 9 month old twins love this teether!  not having any problem with paint coming off like an earlier reviewer stated   sophie is small has an only slightly annoying squeak and is great to have for teething and just playing   this is a go to baby shower gift for me!'\n",
      " u'i gave this as a gift to my dental hygenist for her child   she was delighted with the easy to hold giraffe   this teether toy reminds me of a rubbery giraffe toy my daughter enjoyed so much when she was a baby   my daughter turns 50 this year   what s old is new again!!!!'\n",
      " u'great book made me purchase his other two books   he has a way of writing that makes history so interesting especially if you are from boston area  i have purchased it for a teacher friend and will recommend it to my children and grandchildren  i find great things as well as books at amazon com '\n",
      " u'i got this for my son expecting it to be something he couldn t put down  he sometimes will pick up and mess with it to make the squeaker go off but that s about it  he doesn t use it as a teether  otherwise its a well made product its just my son doesn t like it '\n",
      " u'i could not understand why a baby s toy would be so expensive   but caved into the hype and bought it for my daughter  she loved it and we took it with us everywhere it is soft  durable plastic and has no stinky   plastic odor '\n",
      " u'when i first heard about this teether  i thought it was just a stupid expensive yuppie thing that is overpriced and appeals only to people so much money they don t know what to do with it   i was dead wrong   my daughter \"tried\" her cousin s sophie when she was 7 months old and in a horrible bout of teething  and she didn t want to give it back   i went out and purchased a sophie for her the very next day   this is the only teething toy that ever gave her any relief during teething  and she had a terrible time cutting teeth   the quality of the toy reflects the price   she dropped her sophie at the zoo without me noticing one day  and i had to buy her another one  it s that good   i think sophie is a perfect baby shower gift  as it is tough for us new parents to justify spending so much money on a teether   buy it for a pregnant mom! or if you can spare the cash  definitely go ahead and buy it for your baby   i don t think you ll regret it! note of caution: don t let baby take sophie in the bath as it can damage her squeaker  short or long term  '\n",
      " u'sophie is our family s favorite teether! she is easy for tiny hands to grip on to  and her hooves get back to the molars  so she s perfect for older babies too!  our sophie has survived two babies and yes  she has faded  but she just looks well loved   no rubber odor   well worth the $$ '\n",
      " u'this is just a little baby chew toy but like my daughter in law says  &#34;every baby deserves an overpriced  french chew toy!  she should know she has purchased several and the kids always seem to love them '\n",
      " u'love it! love it! love it!  the best teether i purchased for my baby  i bought several others before finding this one   : '\n",
      " u'my 4 month old loved it instantly and so did my 2 year old   it is easy for him to hold and a great teething toy   when ever he sees it and it squeaks he gets excited and smiles '\n",
      " u'for a baby 3   6 months old  it is just the right size to hold and chew on   vegetable based painted detail and the lack of bpa make this an appealing choice from a toxicity point of view  cute  too!'\n",
      " u'mouth worthy    no crazy chemicals  lots of places and light enough for small hands to hold  could be the most expensive chew toy for babies ever  but it is a crowd pleaser and always a favorite toys for teething babies '\n",
      " u'i love sophie! my grandson has been chewiing on this since age 5 months;   he s 9 months now and still loves it  however  don t leave your baby alone with sophie; her long legs got rammed down his throat and he gagged and spit up '\n",
      " u'if you have a teething baby  sophie is worth the money   our 9 month old already has 8 teeth   sophie has saved us!'\n",
      " u'a favorite  it is easy for the baby to hold and it has a lovely squeak  be sure not to submerse it in water or the squeak will disappear '\n",
      " u'our baby  now 7 months  still love the sophie  while it doesn t entertain him as much now  his favorite part are the legs  not all kids may like it  and it is a tad on the pricey side  but it s safe  and doubles as a toy too '\n",
      " u'if you are looking for a safe teether toy for your infant  buy this  it is adorable  i get asked about it constantly '\n",
      " u'i was a little hesitant about buying this product because of the price and other reviews  but i am so glad i did   my infant son loves this toy   he grabs it by the neck and just chews away on the poor giraffe s head   when my friend s bring their infants over they do the same thing  i am so glad i bought this toy!'\n",
      " u'i really had my doubts but my 5month old son loves this toy!! when i opened the package i was a little set back i thought that sophie would be a little bigger  it is a dog toy for all intents and purposes but one that my son loves soooo it s worth it  i did read the reviews on the \"choking hazard\" i would like to say that it could be a gagging hazard but that is a huge difference between gagging and choking! and despite this my son gags on his own fingers so it s not exactly a danger  if they gag they pull it out of their mouth  i don t think sophie is a huge danger  it s a little overpriced but then again i don t buy many toys for a baby   rattles  a chew toy here and there but nothing expensive to i figure if he loves it then it s worth it!'\n",
      " u'my 4 month old loves this giraffe!  she s not teething yet  but she loves to chew on things  and this giraffe is her favorite thing to chew on   we have a few other teethers  like the teething rings you can freeze  but she doesn t like to chew on those   i would recommend this giraffe to anyone who wants a toy that their baby will love!!'\n",
      " u'my daughter is teething and it s perfect! all the other teething rings seemed to have some hard areas  sophie is soft and has rounded edges   perfect for a teething baby and peace of mind for parents '\n",
      " u'this is not something you would by yourself    great gift! it is safe and used a ton during the teething phase by my lil one '\n",
      " u'although i thought it was a bit over priced  it is definately well paid for!! baby adores this teether  the noise  the feel  the size it is perfect for her!!'\n",
      " u'so far the baby is enjoying the sophie teether  we are a little worried about it near the dog though  it has a squeaker  i didn t realize  and we re afraid the dog might confuse it for one of her toys  and for the price we ll be really mad if it gets eaten  baby is still in the early stages of teething so he s not chomping on it too much  but it is nice variety between frozen teethers '\n",
      " u'this is the best teething toy ever!  my 6 month old loves his \"sophie \"  it is easy for him to grasp and he likes the squeeking noise   i was a little hesitant due to the price   it is worth every penny   i only wish i had discovered this for my first son '\n",
      " u'i had purchased sophie the giraffe for my son  6 months old  about two months ago   this toy has many pros  as well as a couple cons  which i will mention below pros:+ made with natural rubber and safe food grade paint+ soft and comfortable for child to use+ visually stimulating for child s visual growth+ makes noise which helps entertain child+ most importantly  keeps child happy and soothed while teethingcons:  legs are a bit too long  my child has gagged  not choked  on the legs one or two times  the quality is seemingly equivalent to that of a dog toyoverall  this is the best teething device i have ever purchased for my son   much better than a teething ring  and much lighter than the average teething ring   definitely helps to sooth my son '\n",
      " u'my little one loved this thing all the comments of kids choking on it i dont see how that is possible unless their trying to deep throat the head'\n",
      " u'the joke in our house is   that this was orginally created as a dog toy but no one bought it so they repackaged it and called it a \"teether\" but the joke is on us because my daughter loves this  the rubber is really soft and the she loves to make it squeak though it is a bit pricier than your standard teethers it is a very popular toy at our house!'\n",
      " u'my 6 month old loves this!  the squeek keeps him interested while the texture sooths his teething gums   easy to clean and fun to play with '\n",
      " u'my daughter loves her sophie teether  it is the only thing that fits in her mouth and she enjoys really gnawing on for an extended amount of time  i love that is natural rubber and painted with food dyes too  i think it s a must have for any baby  and i wish i would have discovered her with my first two kiddos '\n",
      " u'i had one for my eldest son when he was teething  bought one for the 2nd boy  and he absolutely loves it too   initially i was a little surprise that it came in a size which was smaller than the first one which i had bought somewhere else  from the picture  i cannot tell that actually this teether is sold in different sizes   nevertheless  i gave this to my three month old boy and the smaller size is apparently better for him  though he has not started teething  i haven t seen any teeth despite him constantly chewing   he just loves suckling and chewing on this  this is much better than having him chew on soft toys or other cloth toys  which need constant washing and drying   and the material is also soft and he just loves chewing the ears and the legs '\n",
      " u'this little giraffe is the best   my son has enjoyed it and re discovered her after his teething period   when he was done teething  he re discovered her and started calling her his baby giraffe   you can t go wrong with this product especially at this price '\n",
      " u'good and comfortable he don t cry when he got it  he likes very much  and my baby looks very cute and lovely'\n",
      " u'baby loves this teether  as does the cat! i love the fact that it does not come from china so we know that it is lead free  this alone make it well worth the price    as i looked everywhere for toys/teethers not made in china '\n",

      " u'my 6 month old grandson loves this giraffe  whether he is chewing on it or smacking it around to make it squeak  it s very durable and soft '\n",
      " u'sophie is a little expensive  but worth every penny  my son s pediatrician recommended her and she has saved our ears and sanity    and my baby s smiles  on numerous occasions  my husband tried to buy another for our trip to europe but they were out of stock  we treat sophie like she is made of gold  my son is 5 months old  so no teeth yet  but he likes to bite while working out gas  sophie is fantastic for this  as well as being a great toy  she is in the top three as far as he s concerned  we are still trying to get another    get sophie while you can!'\n",
      " u'i don t know why  but our son  9 months old now  loves this toy  most of the items he liked at 3 months old barely hold his attention for more than 2 minutes now  but sophie is still a popular item  especially for chewing and teething  it is one of the only older toys that still make him smile '\n",
      " u'fantastic and the babies love them   should become a family heirloom if it survives the teething phase   well made and worth the money '\n",
      " u'my baby loves it   lives up to the expectations i had heard about it   it is durable  washable  and easy to grasp '\n",
      " u'while the price is slightly high for a teething toy  my son loved sophie from the moment he saw her  he was about 2 months old when sophie entered his life and was his favorite teether  she does seem slightly flimsy  almost like a cheap dog toy  however  she endured my son teething and never broke  my son was about a nine months old when he lost interest  overall  i recommend her as a supplement to the freezer teething rings!'\n",
      " u'sophie  oh sophie  your time has come  my granddaughter  violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth  what joy little sophie brings to violet  sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough  it is quite easy for violet to twist sophie into unheard of positions to get sophie into her mouth  the little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths  and the drooling has purpose  the paint on sophie is food quality sophie was born in 1961 in france  the maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made sophie from the finest rubber  phthalate free on st sophie s day  thus the name was born  since that time millions of sophie s populate the world  she is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp  violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of sophie  sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist  she has lovely  sizable spots that attract violet s attention  sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from violet  she is able to make sophie squeak and that brings much joy  sophie s smooth skin is soothing to violet s little gums  sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love as you well know the first thing babies grasp  goes into their mouths  how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething  sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag  sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old  how wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find sophie irresistible  viva la sophie!highly recommended   prisrob 12 11 09'\n",

      " u'i bought this for my daughter when she was three months old   she is now four months old and we don t go anywhere without sophie   for the first month i had to hold sophie so she could chew on her  but now she can hold sophie herself   her favorite part to chew on is sophie s face although her front leg and tail are are very close seconds   we haven t had problems with the rubber cracking or paint rubbing off  since it s all natural rubber and paint  with no clear coat   it does have a tendency to hang on to dirt but i just wash it every day with her bottles    some water will get into the squeeker  but it s usually fine after a couple of squeezes  i m getting ready to buy a second sophie so that we can keep one in the diaper bag and one at home   i reluctantly bought the first one after hearing lots of fuss over it    i mean     who needs a $20 dog chew toy?  but sophie was worth every penny '\n",
      " u'sophie is a classic toy that many parents get at their showers  the product is made of high quality and it does what it should do  soothe a teething baby  it makes a squeak every time it s pushed which can get annoying  but it is on the low end of the annoying squeak spectrum  the legs and shape of the giraffe helps baby get to his molars  it s easy to clean with just a quick rinse  there are several mentions of choking hazards so just make sure you don t leave your child alone with the toy if you re looking for more advice on baby products  visit the website allmomsareperfect com and look under  baby gear essentials   there s also a full stroller shopping guide  what to look for in a crib  and what to expect in the hospital during and after delivery  the baby registry post gives you the lowdown on what you need versus what you can do without for the first three months '\n",

      " u'this is the best teether   and we have 8 or 9  not too hard  not too squishy  the dye is made of vegetable oil  so it s ok for babies to chew on  the noise is kind of loud  sounds like a dog toy  but the way the squeaker is placed  it rarely squeaks unless you hold it a certain way  when the kid chews on it  it doesn t squeak  like you have to actually try to squeak it   at first i felt like it looked rather cheap  like a dog toy  but the plastic is sturdy and holds up to all kinds of abuse  got this for my son around 6m and he is currently 21m and still using it now that his incisors are coming in  my biggest issue is it seems to easily pick up lint off the carpet  to clean it  run water over the top while holding it upright  so no water gets inside the toy   my son loves to gnaw on the ears and feet  and there was a time when he couldn t sleep without it  when his teething was really bad '\n",

      " u'sophie is a fantastic teether toy  my son loves giraffes to begin with so imagine when i found this teether i had to get it for him   it is a great toy for babies to chew on  soft and firm with just enough give to relieve their need to chew  the only thing is do not try to microwave sterilize this as i did   i chock it up to first time mom stupidity     it ruins the squeezing mechanism that produces the little squeak sound when you squeeze it   i don t think the baby cares  as he still chews on it all the time and loves talking to it too!  still probably a nice \"toy ish\" feature that i ruined   as tempting as it is to replace  there is nothing wrong with the teether other then the sound so i am stuck with   just don t do it for yourself so that the baby might enjoy the noise maker as well '\n",

      " u'this toy is the perfect toy  my 3 month old grandson can hold onto it and when his mom is desperate  she ll have him suck on the face  because the shape is good for that  while babysitting a very unhappy child  not my grandson  i stuck his sophie s foot in his mouth  and instantly he went to chewing away on it and peace prevailed  it s soft but durable and the neck and legs are great for little hands to hold on to  i suggest getting 2 and keeping one put away in case one gets lost  because the little guys get attached to sophie right away '\n",

      " u'my nephews and my four kids all had sophie in the 70 s and 80 s  and sophie hasn t changed: she is still the perfect teething toy!  she is the perfect size  the perfect weight  the perfect material   babies can grip her easily  hang on easily  and chew on multiple places   she s great in the bath too but her squeeker gets water logged for awhile   she s perfect; a timeless toy!'\n",
      " u'yes  it looks like a dog toy  sounds like a dog toy  and feels like a dog toy  people will give you funny looks    but i can t say enough about sophie  my 4 month old got her today  and this toy has gotten her to use her hands much more than anything else she owns  she loves to hold it and suck on its head  she gets a huge kick out of it when she manages to squeak it buy this toy  it looks like you spent a lot of money on a dog toy  but your child will love it and learn from it!'\n",
      " u'when i washed it off  water got in thr squeaker and it stopped working  it took days for it to start working again  i almost returned it  now i have to put my finger over the squeaker when i clean it off and it does fine '\n",
      " u'i held off on getting this teether thinking someone would get it for me as a gift   when i didn t receive it as a gift  i finally broke down and bought it  despite what i thought was a high price   the second i took sophie out of the package  my daughter fell in love with her   sophie is soft and apparently very comforting to chew on   my daughter loves her   she chews on her head and her feet and it really seems to help while she s teething   i wish i hadn t waited 7 months to buy sophie the only drawback  and this is no fault of the toy/teether itself  is that my dogs are obsessed with it because it is so similar to their dog toys   they wait for my daughter to put it down and then try to grab it   i have to keep it out of their reach whenever my daughter isn t actively using it   trying to teach them not to touch it hasn t worked yet   in response to the person who said it is a dog toy   it is not   yes  it sounds a bit like one and is the texture of one  but it is safe for babies to chew   it is natural rubber and it is made with food grade paint   unlike all of the dog toys that i have  and have seen    it was designed specifically for a baby   it is the perfect shape to hold and gnaw on i am certain if you have a teething baby  you will love this toy!  just be sure to keep it away from your dogs!'\n",
      " u'a friend bought me sophie as soon as she found out i was pregnant   she said i had to have her  but i was skeptical   i first gave it to my daughter around 3 months  but she wasn t interested   then around 6 months  it suddenly became her favorite thing in the world   she loves to chew on her ears and her feet   she can grip it nicely around the neck and wave it around  making it squeak  yes  it squeaks!  when it whack against something   she comes everywhere with us   in the car set  to the doctor to distract her from shots  when we re out shopping to keep her occupied if i have to finish something up   i d say sophie is a must!'\n",
      " u'my 6 month old daughter loves sophie  she has so many places to chew on and is easy for her little hands to hold on to  she chews on her legs and ears and nose  but even more than that she likes to grab sophie around her neck  somewhat disturbing to see sometimes  and squeeze her repeatedly to hear the squeak! the squeak was a problem at first because my dog thought the toy was for her  when my sister visits with her young husky  we have to keep sophie away because the husky tries to steal it from the baby! my daughter loves the attention from the dogs so she thinks it s great  but i could see where it would be a problem if you have a younger dog who might be more aggressive about taking sophie away  i was slightly worried at first from the reviews about sophie s legs being a choking hazard  but i haven t noticed that at all  my daughter might have gagged on one of the legs at first  but she gags on her own hands more than she does with sophie  and gagging is certainly different from airway obstruction  i would recommend sophie to all my friends  who don t have ambitious dogs! '\n",
      " u'i ve never met a baby who doesn t like sophie   she s a legend in our home  where my daughter does not take a paci but loves to chew on sophie!  i received an extra by mistake from my baby shower  but am sure glad i did  because if one falls on the grocery store floor or something  there s another clean one at all times   also  when we have play dates  it s nice to have two  because inevitably both kids go for sophie   we also have the bath tub sophie which isn t quite as awesome due to a different texture  but still gets lots of love   some things are worth the price  and this toy is!'\n",

      " u'seems a bit silly to me  but this giraffe actually does have a pretty cute face and smile  not that some babies could even focus on it  at least in their early infancy sophie is quite soft and malleable  nice  pretty brown spots  with a pleasant &#34;squeaker&#34; in her   she s a much better thing for babies to chew on than plenty of other things they might put into their mouths   washable  but from what i m reading  don t wash sophie in the dishwasher or in especially hot water '\n",

      " u'i purchased this for my grand daughter for christmas  since then she has cut her first two teeth with sophie  she loves this teether! it is easy for her to hold on to with the legs or neck  it s soft  smooth texture is also pleasing to infants   we were out shopping one day and she saw another little baby with a sophie and she wanted it  of course  we had forgotten hers that day!  this is a great teether and would make any child happy  would make a great gift since it is a little more costly than most teethers  but well worth the money>'\n",
      " u'we adore this little giraffe; it was the first thing we bought when we found out we were pregnant   timeless!'\n",
      " u'this is a no brainer    this toy is like baby crack  every baby i know adores sophie  my daughter now loves her for the squeak  but she chewed on every part of sophie s body for the entire first year  pretty much  i love that it is made with natural materials  what is the mystery of sophie? my husband and i think it must be because it s such an interesting shape  most baby teething toys are round  or some simple but geometric shape  this one has fun bendy hooves  wiggly ears  and a most excellent nose to gnaw on  it s a toy i buy for every friend who gets pregnant '\n",
      " u'an excellent toy for teething babies   it is so much better than anything in the market  i saw my friend s daughter playing with it and loving it; at first i thought that the sqeeks can be too loud   me and my baby hate loud noises   but he got it a couple of days ago and he loves it  he just turned three months and most other teething toys are too heavy for him to hold  or too difficult to grab on   sophie is very light and easy to hold  he chews on her ears and legs  when the toys slips out of his hands he likes to look at it  this morning before falling asleep he was looking at his giraffe and smiling  the two cons are the rubber smell  it took him some time to get used to it so he could put the toy in his mouth  and price  it is slightly overpriced   guess due to its popularity and advertising  other vulli toys are cheaper   but when a baby needs to chew on something and nothing seems to work  most parents are willing to pay extra for a safe and lovely looking toy '\n",
      " u'had one for my first two children but it had seen a lot of love so i bought another one for my third child  i don t know what it is with these giraffes  but babies just love them  they are easy to hold  soft to chew on  great baby toy and something i buy for new parents '\n",
      " u'i purchased this teether for my daughter when she was 4 months old and she loved it right away  it was the perfect size for her small hands  easy for her to hold on to and the material is perfect for chewing on  now she is 7 months old and she still loves it  the neck and legs make it easy for her to hold and shake before she bites down  there are some areas where the paint has rubbed off  but not in chips or chunks  i was worried about the \"choking hazard\" that other reviewers mentioned  but she has never had a problem  the legs are not long enough for her to jam down her throat  and the head is too big and awkward with the ears sticking out  it really does look  and sound  like a dog toy  but as much as she loves it  it was worth the price '\n",
      " u'it makes happy squeaking sounds  is safe for baby s teething  is easy for baby to hold onto  and it s basically indestructible '\n",
      " u'there is a reason there is so much hype surrounding sophie   she really is that amazing  always a great shower gift  sophie manages to make children adore her without crazy bright colors or vibrations or flashing lights  just a simple almost vintage feeling design  a silly squeaker sound we squeezed  and somehow both my infant and even his 4 year old brother just adore sophie and she gets daily play  this was the first toy my infant son learned to grasp  at only 2 5 months  and is a must have item whenever we pack the diaper bag  in fact im looking to buy a backup sophie just in case anything ever happened to the first   dont know what we would do without her!'\n",
      " u'my baby loves this giraffe   he loves to look at its face and has figured out how to make it squeak   and of course he loves to chew it!  i d give it five stars if it were a little less expensive  but all in all  great baby toy!'\n",
      " u'we did not purchase this from amazon  but received it as a gift   overall  we like this teether  it smells pleasant  it s soft  looks friendly and a cute little squeak   the only concern we have is if he could choke on the legs   we feel that we should always supervise our 2 5 month old '\n",
      " u'my wife and i were skeptical at first because of the price  i mean $15 for a rubber giraffe  because of all the great reviews we decided to get it anyway  our daughter is 5 1/2 months old and she will chew on sophie s legs for a half and hour without a problem  anyway needless to say we love sophie and recommend it highly '\n",
      " u'my daughter instantly loved sophie when i handed it to her   this is perfect for her gums and her tooth that is coming in   i highly recommend this to every mom and dad   my daughter is a lot happier!!'\n",
      " u'thank you very much receipt of the product  which was in excellent condition and in conformity with the specifications mentioned in the presentationi hope all the shops dealing directly with saudi arabia'\n",
      " u'my mom used to talk about a giraffe toy my brother had as a baby   when i ordered this for my son  she was surprised and said this was the same toy she always talked about!  my son wasn t crazy about any other teethers  but loved sophie   i ve since gotten this as a gift for several friends/family members as gifts for their babies   love!'\n",
      " u'very pretty  safe material  good to pratise grasping with  different parts can be chewed on  my baby looks so cute when she holds the giraff in hand '\n",
      " u'my 9 mo instantly took to this teether   it became his favorite     and i love this its natural rubber  i hate him putting plastic products in his mouth!'\n",
      " u'when we first got this teether in i thought it was just a glorified dog toy  it squeaks and it s rubber  i was like whats the big deal  it just drives my dog crazy  my son at first was the same way  but once his teeth started hurting and the started bitting on it he loved it  it was love at first bite  i have it in our diaper bag at all time because for some reason this giraffe can calm him  i don t know how it works but it does  this teether has helped this mom out a lot during those stressful teething times '\n",
      " u'baby d never leaves home with out his sophie!  i like that he likes it  and that it s made of natural materials   super easy to squeek  but the dogs get confused! lol!'\n",
      " u'bought this for my 4 month old nephew who was teething  my grandaughter also has one and loves it  just the right size and feel  has quickly become a favorite  i think they would highly recommend sophie the giraffe!'\n",
      " u'i bought this for my teething puppy  and i love that my puppy loves chewing on it  i know it s a bit unusual to buy a baby toy for a puppy  but i noticed that my puppy didn t particularly like all the tough chew toys out there  so  i did a little research and found vulli  my puppy loves chewing on vulli because she is soft and squeaks easily one thing to note is that vulli is extremely soft compared to typical dog chew toys so if your puppy is rough  he can easily puncture vulli  i actually made the mistake of letting one of our friends  adult dog play with vulli  and he instantly chewed a hole in vulli so that she no longer squeaked  i quickly ordered a replacement  and vulli has survived the many weeks my puppy has played with her since '\n",
      " u'really great for the tiny ones   easy to hold and chew on at the same time  really likedthe productand will reccomend it '\n",
      " u'very fast delivery!  i can t wait to give it to my new neice!thank you!'\n",
      " u'my son loves this toy! it s perfect for when your little one is teething  becareful if you have a dog that likes sqeaker toys  the first time my son squeaked it our dog ran right over to it  now we have to watch to make sure the dog doesn t try to grab it  :  '\n",
      " u'my daughter got this when she was around 3 months old and just loves to gnaw on her little giraffe and to squeak it!  super cute!'\n",
      " u'my daughter  now 7 months old  adores her sophie   yes  it does have a very faint smell  the rubbery odor on ours has faded until it s nearly gone and we ve not had it that long   and i still don t really let her play with any toy unsupervised  but she loves to hold it  bite it  squeeze it  squeak it and pass it from hand to hand   i really love this little toy   it makes her smile every time she sees it  it s her preferred teether  and of all the toys and teethers she has that are top rated on amazon it s this one she loves the best  she reaches for it every time  and i m using it to help her practice crawling '\n",
      " u'i love this toy  it even has a little squeaker inside  my daughter loves it too  she looks so cute chewing on the body parts  my husband does not like the toy very much  he thinks it looks like an expensive dog toy '\n",
      " u'i originally thought $20 was some what on the high end for a teething toy   if you have a teething baby at home you will understand that no amount is to much to soothe your baby   from the moment i saw this little giraffe i fell in love with how cute it was and is   my daughter got her 1st two teeth by 3 1/2 months and now at 6 months she already has six teeth   i am very happy with this product and think it s especially good for young babies since it s easy to hold   i also love the fact that it squeaks and so does my daughter '\n",
      " u'my daughter is 4 months old  and is really starting to chew on things   i wanted something safe  so i bought her a sophie   she loves it!  once she discovered she could make it squeak  she liked it even more   the rubber does have kind of a strange smell  but that doesn t seem to bother her   she likes to chew on the legs the most   i would definitely recommend this product for other little teethers out there '\n",
      " u'i love this toy because when my daughter drools or spits up on sophie it s easy to clean  her other toys that are fabric hold all the fluids and have to be washed in the washing machine often  sophie can be easily wiped or rinsed  it s a little pricey for what it is though '\n",
      " u'it is the best teether ever  it does the job and my son loves it  every baby should have one '\n",
      " u'great teether  soft and hard and noisy in all of the right places    the baby loves it!!!'\n",
      " u'i bought sophie for all the little teethers in my life this year   there were four   for holiday gifts   well  the feedback has been terrific   these arrived on time as promised before christmas and were quite well received by the children as well as their parents   what a perfect gift!'\n",
      " u'i used this with my son and loved it  i now like to give it as a gift to expectant/new mothers '\n",
      " u'i have triplets   when i first got the product in the mail  i was disappointed   it looked like a cheap dog toy   but!  my kids love it!  well worth the money '\n",
      " u'6 month old grand daughter loves to chew on it helps for teething it is cute and right size for baby  soft and easy for baby to handle '\n",
      " u'this is the 2nd sophie i have purchased  for my grandkids   my grandson took his everywhere and i mean everywhere so consider getting the sophie teether for the bathtub also   my granddaughter is just loving hers also  and i am so glad that it is something that will calm them down while they are teething  we all know how hard that is   i have another gradchild to be born in may and i plan to buy sophie aheadof time for him or her  my granddaughter is teething early so i plan to be prepared for the next one  this is just my preference but i only buy the original vulli sophie giraffe i know it worked for my first grandson so well  why mess with perection  totally worth the money '\n",
      " u'vulli sophie the giraffe teether is a classic toy!  i was skeptical but thought i d give it a try and i am so glad i did!  my son loved it starting at about 4 months  the only thing is the squeaker does resemble my dog s toys  so on occasion a person may have to rustle it away if the have a dog that loves squeaky toys  otherwise a great toy!'\n",
      " u'my daughter told me babies love sophie so i have been buying these as gifts   so adorable and charming   love her!'\n",
      " u'i got this for my baby when he was around 5 months old  he loved chewing on it from day one  it was a little smaller than i expected but it was light and very easy for the baby to handle  you have to squeeze the body or head to get it to squeeze  when the baby is chewing on it  you just hear a rubbing rubber noise the baby is now 8 months old with two teeth and still like to chew on it  sophie is still looking pretty good but the color has started to fade on the areas where chews on the most  ears and hooves  your friends will make fun of you for buying such an expensive \"chew toy\" but it is totally worth it : '\n",
      " u'my daughter is 8 months now and still loves her \"sophie\"   we got this for her when she was three months and  now that the teeth are coming in full force  sophie offers her some relief  even as the baby gets more \"play\" oriented sophie seems to be a top \"go to\" toy  well worth the price '\n",
      " u'sophie is well worth the money! our 6 month old son loves it  it is the only teether that he is able to hold firmly and put any part of it in his mouth  the squeaker is slightly annoying  but tolerable  the surface is a bit tacky and helps him hold onto it better than most toys  and not drop it as esaily in restaurants  etc  '\n",
      " u'my 4 month old son is teething  and i ve tried all kinds of teethers  but none seem to satisfy him  so  when i read the reviews for sophie  i figured all these people couldn t be wrong  when i first got her  i was glad that sophie is not hard  inflexible rubber  which she looks like from the picture  she is much softer  like the rubbery consistency of a dog toy  which some people have already commented on  my thoughts regarding sophie s likeness to a dog toy is not a far fetched comparison; this is especially so with the way the squeaker sounds  our dog loves this thing! i have to hide it  but he goes sniffing for it  anyway  when our son first got his hands on this thing  it went straight into his mouth  and he smiles every time sophie squeaks  which is so cute to see  he also smiles when he \"gums\" sophie s body  especially her legs  hooves  actually   so  judging from the way my son puts it in his mouth  and smiles when he does so  i d say she was a worthwhile purchase  but it is very pricey  nonetheless  which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5  it s handmade  made of natural rubber  from the sap of the havea tree   hand painted with food grade colors  and the finished product takes 14 steps to complete  it s been around since 1961  or 65  i can t remember and hasn t changed since  but even though she ll be a keepsake  the price is exaggerated  if you want a teether that works  however  sophie is worth it '\n",
      " u'love that this is made of natural rubber  perfect for my little one to slobber all over  ha! i totally recommend  : '\n",
      " u'a lot of my friends are having children and this is becoming my go to baby shower present   their babies love sophie!at stores  mostly boutiques  you ll find it for $20+   amazon com has the best price!'\n",
      " u'everyone loves this thing   i think my daughter likes it  but it is far from her favorite toy to chew on   maybe it will grow on her    '\n",
      " u'my son loves his sophie  it small enough for him to hold and chew and soft enough that he doesn t hurt himself  so   we both love sophie!!!! and the seller shipped so fast   it was great all around!!!!'\n",
      " u'my first born loved his sophie the giraffe when he was teething  she is very cute and good for a girl or a boy  i have since bought 2 as presents and new one for baby #2  i have not figured out how to clean her without washing away her spots '\n",
      " u'my daughter is 6 months and she loves this  very easy to grab and great for soothing those teeth '\n",
      " u'i just noticed this morning when i caught the end of the movie in the emotional taxi scene towards the end  this is the last thing he gives the baby: my son loved teething on this and it is great for reaching both the back 2 year old molars and the tough front canines my son still likes to play with his giraffe!'\n",
      " u'baby loves this  i just bought second to keep at grandmas  but it seems different than the first one i bought  is this possible?  amazon sold both teethers to me so i dont get it   the first one is very soft and flexible but the second one i got today is pretty stiff and is a darker color '\n",
      " u'after spending a small fortune on teethers i decided to try sophie and glad i did   my niece loves it   only negative thing is you cannot place them in hot water or the dishwasher   we may invest in other vulli teethers '\n",
      " u'what a cute giraffe! he s going to be well loved by our new granddaughter! what a fun toy for her  especially during teething times!'\n",
      " u'my 6 month old loves her sophie giraffe! we have 2   just in case! it instantly calms her down when she s fussy! great for teething!'\n",
      " u'my baby girl loves this toy  she s had it ever since she was born and loves it still  10 months later she likes to chew on vulli s legs  it soothes her gums when teething highly recommended stephanie h'\n",
      " u'i had heard all the rave reviews about sophie  but really didn t want to spend $20 on a rubber baby toy  it just seemed ridiculous   but when teething came on full force in our house  we were pretty much willing to do anything to give the baby some relief   he loved sophie right away and i knew we weren t going to regret getting it for him   the toy is easy for a baby to hold and chew on  giving lots of relief for painful gums but   the squeaker  i hate that squeaker  it absolutely does not need to squeak  it doesn t entertain the baby at all  the only thing is does seem to do is drive the dog bonkers  i d rip that squeaker out if i could   having said that  i don t think the squeaker should deter you from purchasing sophie  it s a great teething toy otherwise i will say  the baby seems a little less interested in sophie when he s not actively teething  but that s alright with me  she ll be waiting for him when the next tooth starts to appear '\n",
      " u'when i purchased this  i didn t realize it had a squeeker inside that makes it sound like a dog chew toy   i think i still would have purchased it with all of the high ratings  but this caught me off guard   we purchased this for my 3 month old son who is teething   he hasn t quite gotten to the stage where everything he grabs goes into his mouth  so he won t play with the giraffe and gnaw on it as we hoped   if you hold the head  specifically the ears  to his mouth  he will chew on them for just a second before spitting it out   i m hoping that he ll grow into this toy  but for now it gets a mediocre review   i ll update if/when he becomes a fan of this chew toy **update:  well  it has been several weeks now  and he loves his sophie   it s tied for top chew toy with the nuby chew thing that looks like a peanut at the top   overall fairly happy  but still wish it didn t squeak '\n",
      " u'my baby enjoys bashing sophie into everything that she sees  she likes the squeaking noise it makes  if we go anywhere  sophie had better be there too!'\n",
      " u'as a mother of 16month old twins; i bought sophie [1 for each  of course] when they were 4 months old after careful reading of all reviews  i heard great things about sophie and wanted to give her a try  at 4 months babies can t do much more than grasp and semi gnaw on sophie  for many months i had to squeeze sophie myself [which i personally enjoyed] and set it on their laps  they loved sophie  the squeak is loud and sounds exactly like a dog s squeaky chew toy  just for those who are wondering as they grew and their motor skills developed to each milestone  sophie gained more and more individual babytime  the twins were able to squeeze her themselves and chew on her around the clock  they love to throw her  stretch her  squeeze her  chew on her  drool on her    you name it  they have done it  one of the two sophie s took an extended vacation out in the back yard [unbeknownst to me] and once found  a little water had her looking like a champ again    ready to face another day of playtime they still enjoy squeezing sophie [2 at once can do a number on your ears though] over all: sophie is durable  soft rubber  easily squeezable  and a very cute toy with over a year of teething twins  sophie has not faded  or been worn down  no stretching  or flaking of paint or rubber don t be lead astray by bad reviews  this is a great product the age range i would recommend would be from 6months   15months  that is where sophie will get the most use out of your little one '\n",
      " u'i bought sophie from amazon before my daughter was even born  it was highly rated and figured it was good  it is! my daughters now 6 months and has been playing and biting sophie since she was 3 months  she loves sophie  : '\n",
      " u'this was one of my son s favorite toys and now we ve been giving them  from him  to everyone we know that is expecting and they ve all loved her   soft  squeaky  cute and  most importantly  safe   spreading a little sophie has been a huge success!'\n",
      " u'well worth the price   this is very durable   my little guy had 8 teeth by the time he was 7 months and has gnawed on this thing like you wouldn t believe   it is in the same great condition as when we got it   the legs of the giraffe allow little ones to localize teething more efficiently '\n",
      " u'i bought this for my 9 month old  she has been teething forever and she doesn t like the normal teething toys   the few times she s been able to get it from her older brothers  she has loved it   i have to keep reminding my 2 1/2 year old and 4 year old that it is not their toy and to give it to their sister   so  obviously it s a big hit here!  i like that i don t have to worry about lead paint or bpa and all that '\n",
      " u'this is hands down one of the best baby products we have   particularly at this stage  approximately 5 months   my expectations were very high given the positive reviews  and they were easily met  our little one spends so much time chewing on sophie s head  then sophie s ears  then a leg  then she tries to get all four legs in her mouth  etc  the design makes it really easy for little hands to hold on to  sophie is my go to toy when we are in public and i need to occupy the baby with something  yes  it is a little pricey  we received it as a gift and i probably would have balked at spending so much money on a teething toy  but i m very happy that we have it '\n",
      " u'i heard from many people to buy this product  my son is obsessed with it   not sure what makes sophie so much more fun to chew on than all of his other toys  but i definitely recommend this one!'\n",
      " u'my son chewed on this giraffe for 3 months straight  it s been washed in the laundry and the dishwasher multiple times  it still looks new  now that he s a year old  he still likes this toy to play with  i don t know if it s worth $30    but  yes    there s definitely something about sophie that attracts babies  it s kind of weird '\n",

      " u'i thought that sophie would be a harder rubber  but this is kinda of flimsy and makes me wonder if he could bite through it with teeth   also didn t know that it squeaked until i opened the package   he won t be able to chew on this in quiet areas  aka church etc   it is really cute and he loves to chew on it so i gave it 4 stars   some reviews talk about choking on this toy  i ve had no issues with him gagging/choking on it   my mother in law did make fun of the price i paid for it  but i was willing to pay it for natural rubber and no china lead paint on the toy '\n",

      " u'i bought it for my 8 month old  i know it s late  from another merchant   she did not like it  does not play with it  does not enjoy it  and does not teeth it at all  it does not feel like a $25 toy  right now  it s on sale on amazon and so not that bad but it s a simple squeaking tether  agreed it may be safe due to food grade paints and such but for $25  you can buy much better toys  i think it is over hyped and overrated  the fair price should be around $8 and $15 is maximum of what someone desperate to buy it should pay '\n",
      " u'what a waste of $20  i don t know what all the hype is about  it s just a tiny squeaky giraffe  i could have gotten any tiny squeaky toy that my baby put in his mouth and called it a teether and sold it for $20 my baby is 4 months old and doesn t care much for it   '\n",
      " u'the giraffe itself is cute  like another review i saw  i agree it def  isn t much different than a dog toy  it s soft rubbery and squeaks just like one  not to put it down but i have dog toys that feel and squeeze just like it  lol it was smaller and flimsier than i thought it would be  it was a very expensive trial and error teething toy  my son just would not chew on it no matter how much i offered it to him  he would rather chew on a blanket  at first i thought maybe it had a funny taste because it has a rubbery smell at first so i washed it several times rinsed it well and tried again with no avail he just didn t like it '\n",
      " u'i was very excited getting this product but my son was not interested in it in the least   very disappointed   i will not recommend this product to anyone not to mention the price for it is ridiculous '\n",
      " u'my son really likes this toy  but not necessarily more than his other toys  i still like it though  the only downsides are that it is too expensive and also the squeaker became dislodged about a week after we got it  so it does not make noise any more  so sad '\n",
      " u'baby shows absolutely no interest in this toy   refuses to put it in mouth even though likes gumming on just about everything else   the giraffe has a chalky rubbery texture so i can understand why   we use it as a squeeker   i like that it is made in france '\n",
      " u'i had high hopes for this highly praised teether   baby loves to chew on it  but only for short amounts of time   it s the taste of rubber that baby finds unappealing   i have washed the toy in warm soapy water several times and still cannot get rid of the rubbery taste   my son will chew on it  then gets a look of disgust across his face  chew on it more  drools  more looks of disgust  then eventually drops it   i put it in my mouth to see what all the weird looks are about and sure enough it has a weird rubbery taste no matter how many times i wash it   after my baby is done chewing on it  i go to give him a kiss and his mouth and cheeks smell \"rubbery\"   i also have to watch him closely because the giraffe legs can easily gag baby  but that s his favorite part to chew on  of course   other than those two gripes it s a good teether   it s soft  good size  cute  and my son is attracted to it   just wish i could make it not smell/taste so bad!'\n",
      " u'my daughter  5 months really isn t into it  which is a bummer since it is the priciest teether i ve ever purchased    also  when it squeaks it reminds me of a dog toy  it is a little odd  i love giraffes  maybe she will like it more in a few months '\n",
      " u'my son loves this  he his 16 weeks and it is one of his favorite teethers   this is although not a toy i would ever let him play with without me near him and watching closely   the legs are long and slim and he likes to shove them in his mouth  the issue is that the legs are also close together so at 16 weeks they legs actually can get stuck on his inner and outter checks  although he has not gagged or choked yet i have read of other babies doing this i only allow play time when i am holding him with the toy  if he didn t love it so much i would return it '\n",
      " u'i was expecting something make of a harder plastic  like the one a friend of mine has  this had a more   rubbery dog toy consistancy  my daughter still chews on it  but it doesn t really do much in the way of teething '\n",
      " u'the giraffe is very very smelly  i ve been airing it and hope the smell would go away  but it s still very strong whenever my baby holds it in his hands  his hands would be smelly too my baby doesnt like chewing it  so i m glad  i am not sure it s as safe as what it s proclaimed to be  because the smell is just too strong what a waste of money    i guess at least my baby likes to look at it  that s all '\n",
      " u'i had a sophie i had forgotten i bought   also from amazon   recently i purchased another   the box on the recent one looked a  little \"off\" to me so i came here looking for answers   the new box  instead of saying vulli in the upper right hand corner  says  \"sophie la girafe \"  this fake one has fluorescent pink on the tongue and cheeks and smells like chemicals   it also has lighter paint for the spots and doesn t stand on it s own   the genuine one has a serial number on the back of her leg  the fake one doesn t have a serial number   this is a real shame   both boxes have stickers on the bottom that say  \"imported & distributed by calisson inc   [   ]  i ve ordered several over the last few years   i hope i haven t given bad ones to babies '\n",
      " u'i seriously don t know what all the fuss is about this thing   yes my daughter likes it somewhat but she is not in love   doesn t like it enough to justify $20 on a chew toy   i say chew toy because i ve had several people tell me they thought it looked like a dog toy   waaaaaaaaay overpriced '\n",
      " u'we received the sophie on a wednesday and by monday  with minimal use by my 5 month old  the squeaker was completely broken  she vaguely enjoys the feet and head for chewing  but it definitely is not the be all and end all of teethers  especially for the price  i expected it to be much higher quality and much more sturdy for almost $20 '\n",
      " u'before you buy an expensive teether like sophie the giraffe  figure out if your baby even likes teethers by trying a cheaper  bpa free one from target  $3    i found out my baby is indifferent to teethers after i bought sophie for $21   he prefers his hand or thumb  he simply looks at sophie  then looks away '\n",
      " u'i bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old   she s now 26 months and throughout this time sophie got about the same amount of use which was little to none   my daughter liked it at first but just for an hour  after that it went into her pile of toys   she never used it to chew on or carried it anywhere overtime it has faded and all the spots are off which was a huge disappointment considering the cost of this teether   she occasionally picks it up now and makes it squeak and brings a smile to her face then it gets tossed aside again   there were many other much cheaper teethers that she had which she used a lot more '\n",
      " u'not worth the $16 17 for my kid  she barely plays with it  i find myself dangling it in front of her to get my money s worth   hardly what i was shooting for when i bought it  it is cute  maybe somebody s baby loves it  but not mine  i think it just doesn t do enough to keep her entertained  there s no bells and whistles  just a squeak toy  i d say if your child is already to the point where they are playing with toys that function by pushing buttons  this giraffe is not going to keep their interest  my baby is teething  but this toy does not satisfy her need to chew  she likes cold water filled teethers '\n",
      " u'going by the amazon reviews  there was too much hype for the product  my 10 month old son does not care about the giraffe much  though it is well built  it is definitely not worth the price  this also comes a small booklet that contains the story of sophie and contains phrases like \"jealously guarded trade secrets\"  think twice before buying '\n",
      " u'my little one does not like it  this product has an odor to it  washed it and it still smells '\n",
      " u'when i received this the paint was peeling off in places   i put it through the dishwasher to see if that would help but more kept peeling off so i threw it out   terrible product and unsafe to give to babies   i know everyone raves about this giraffe and i think it would have been great had it not been for the paint   not worth the risk '\n",
      " u'i bought this toy for my 5 month old daughter   it s ok  she enjoys it  but it isn t her favorite teether   i would not spend the money to buy another '\n",
      " u'my son  now 2 5  loved his sophie  and i bought one for every baby shower i ve gone to  now  my daughter  6 months  just today nearly choked on it and i will never give it to her again  had i not been within hearing range it could have been fatal  the strange sound she was making caught my attention and when i went to her and found the front curved leg shoved well down her throat and her face a purply/blue i panicked  i pulled it out and she vomited all over the carpet before screaming her head off  i can t believe how my opinion of this toy has changed from a must have to a must not use  please don t disregard any of the choking hazard comments  they are not over exaggerated!'\n",
      " u'i bought this for my teething 6 month old for christmas because i like giraffes and thought it would be a cute toy   it is  but i was surprised that the squeaker was so loud   it s like one of those annoying squeaking dog toys   she has had it for a couple of weeks now and doesn t really get excited about playing with it   she got some b  squeeze blocks that she loves much more  they are all different colors and have textures on them  plus the squeaking is really subdued   i would recommend getting those over this toy '\n",
      " u'my baby wasn t interested in this expensive teether  i was disappointed because  well  sophie is cute and i like her  i think it depends on the baby if the purchase is worth it  my cousin s baby is a few months younger than my son and she loves it  i gave it to her to enjoy '\n",
      " u'i received this in a box set as a gift  it came with a embroidered giraffe wash cloth in a cute little box  as soon as i saw the box i was excited bc i was wondering what was in such a beautiful box with this adorable picture on the front  that is where the excitement ended  i opened the box and saw two of the cheapest baby gifts i could possible encounter  the wash cloth began to unravel as soon as i carefully unhooked it from a board it was attached to  it is very thin and looks as if it will barley survive the washing machine on the gentle cycle  the toy now is kind of junky  the plastic is cheap and feels kind of grain y when touched even after being washed several times  my baby in not even slightly interested in this toy as soon as she saw it she threw it to the side  now after reading about this toy being a choking hazard i will be putting it away and let her continue to play with her rattles and such  i think i will keep the box though  it is the best part of the set  it can be used as storage for little toys etc '\n",
      " u'this is a super cute toy that my baby really enjoyed but it got dirty and there is a little hole you have to cover to prevent it from breaking and losing its squeak  unfortunately this toy is way overpriced for the quality as mine is just a silent chewie now and that takes the fun out of my baby s learning and play experience  he isnt interested in it anymore  1 star because it is the lowwest i could go  needs a warning label on how to wash it '\n",
      " u'i can see why mothers swear by this toy  and i knew i just had to try it  my daughter plays with it from time to time  but normally just picks it up and throws it aside  my son wasn t too impressed by it either  he just enjoyed squeaking it in our faces and trying to be as loud as possible with it i can see where this would come in handy for teething babies since the legs/feet of the giraffe are designed for baby s mouths and have a nice rubber feel to them  it helps at times to give this to my daughter so she doesn t have to chew on my fingers or random toys around the house  but she becomes uninterested in it quickly i m upset that i paid so much for it for the lack of use this item gets  but that s the risk one takes  i was a little confused too as to why babies would love this item so much  it reminds me of a rubber dog toy !i wish i could love this product since it s recommended by so many  but with two uninterested kids and two confused parents by the logic of this item   it just wasn t the best purchase for us '\n",
      " u'i purchased this for my 5 month old daughter and she appears to like it  very cute  i do have to agree with other users though and say that sophie reminds me of a dog toy  my dog thought it was for her  i also have to agree that it is a little smelly  i m hoping the smell will diminish over time  my daughter does not seem to mind the smell at all though and really loves the squeaker  i appreciate that it is made of natural rubber  i probably would not purchase again as i think the price is a little steep  regardless of how  amazing  she is  i can think of cheaper natural teethers that my daughter would like just as well  oh  and i did purchase this knowing that legs were a possible choking hazard  which is why i only let her play with it under close supervision '\n",
      " u'i heard so many good reviews about this product and decided i had to try it out with my daughter  when i first searched it and saw the price  i was astonished  wow  that s pretty expensive  but it sure must be worth it with all the people that have bought them  so i gave in and ordered it  not wanting to miss out on this great new teething toy   i must have bought a different version  the toy i received is of no higher quality than a dog toy you would buy at the dollar store  a 3 month old would not know the difference  it s soft rubber so it s easy on her gums and she likes to chew on the ears and bottom of sophie  not even 10 minutes after i introduced the toy to my daughter  the coloring started to peel off it s head  that s not really safe if you ask me  i wouldn t want my baby ingesting plastic peeling  i pulled off the part that started peeling though and kept a close eye on it  so far the peeling has stopped  also  my baby loves the squeaking aspect  but our dogs also pep up every time they hear it  i know that no matter how hard i try to prevent it  sooner or later  sophie will meet a sad demise as a dog toy needless to say  the product did not live up to my expectations even though my baby likes it just fine  it wasn t worth the money '\n",
      " u'i recently ordered this as a gift and compared the this one to the one my son has and wow u can tell it s fake  the serial number is hard to read and the rubber is way harder than the authentic ones and it s has a funny smells!! so not the original vulli sophia'\n",
      " u'despite all theses pretty reviews  i wish i could know why my son didn t like it!! i bought 2 of them  the first when he was 5 months old and i thought i might introduced it early  later  and because my neighbor girl kept biting it when she came and they refused to take it  my wife cleaned it in the dishwasher :  then  i had to get him a new one when he was 8 months old  unfortunately  he didn t like either  so  i quite '\n",
      " u'my baby is more interested in any other teether  or clothes  i trust on line reviews  and successfully bought so many interesting toys except this one  it is a waste of money '\n",
      " u'maybe i got defective one   baby was chewing on it and the color was coming off    my baby s mouth and around her mouth was orange from the color from the giraffe    we stopped using it '\n",
      " u'the sophie giraffe has a very strong rubber odor and my son doesnt like it  also  due to the texture it picks up ever the tiniest of dirt or hair and is hard to clean '\n",
